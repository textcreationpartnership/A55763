            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE <hi>Claims</hi> and <hi>Pretensions</hi> OF THE French King, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THOUGH there be nothing of positive Certainty known, in reference to the Time when States and Kingdoms Began, yet we make no scruple to believe that they were as Ancient as the World. <hi>Adam</hi> was a King over his Children. <hi>Cain,</hi> and his other Sons, were Kings also over theirs. And after the Deluge, the Fathers, and the Eldest Sons, most assuredly govern'd their Families with an Authority little inferiour to that which now-a-days Princes assume over us: with this difference, however, that as they were Natural Fathers, they were likewise sensible of those Real Affections which alway enclin'd 'em to Mildness and Moderation, and which induc'd 'em never to employ themselves but in the laudable Care of procuring the Welfare and Repose of those over whom either Nature or Fortune had given the Authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Masters. In that, far remote from the Politicks of the greatest part of Sovereigns not only now-a-days, but of distant Ages who persuade Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, That the People were Created, and the Throne Erected for them. A Maxim so much the more dangerous, in regard that the Courts of Princes are always crouded with Flatterers, who, without ceasing, instill it into the Ears of Princes, as most certainly believing that it is the most assured Means to insinuate themselves into their Favour. From thence come Taxes, Impositions, Vexations, Acts of Injustice, and Wars.</p>
               <p>That after the Deluge, Fathers and the Eldest Sons were Kings in their Families, is no more then what we clearly find in the Book of <hi>Genesis;</hi> where the Oeconomy of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of the Twelve Tribes, is exactly laid down before u, together with the Wars which they wag'd against the Kings their Neighbours, who could be no other then they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46341:4"/> were, the Heads of some certain Families, more-especially in the Time of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For there is no likelyhood that he could so easily have vanquisht Five Kings at a time, had they been Potent Princes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we arre bound to believe, that Small and Petty Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, fearing to be oppress'd, joyn'd themselves with the more Numerous; who being continually augmented and re-inforc'd by their Assistance, were able, in process of Time, to spread thmselves into Conquest, and to set up Powerful Dominions.</p>
               <p>We shall not here trouble our selves to give an Account what Empires were the First that flourish'd in the World, that being none of our Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 'Tis sufficient to tell yee by the bye, That several maintain the First and most Ancient Monarchy to be that of the <hi>Assyrians:</hi> and that others, on the contrary, assert the Monarchy of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be more Ancient then the former; which, in the Time of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> vaunted to the World a Pedigree of several Hundreds of Kings. Laying therefore this Question aside, which makes nothing to our purpose, we shall only speak of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Government which were and are still extant among Men. These are usually reduc'd into Three sorts, under which, 'tis said, all the rest are comprehended; that is to say, <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monarchy</hi> is that which resigns the Sovereign Power into the Hands of One Single Person, who acknowledges none but God and the Laws to be above him. Of that kind are now-a-days the Monarchies of <hi>France, Spain, Swedeland, Denmark, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristocratical Government</hi> admits into the Administration of it, a certain Number of Persons, more or less, Noble or Burgesses, yet all distinguish'd by their Birth, which gives 'em a Right of Lordship; as is to be seen at <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Senate of Noblemen Commands after a Sovereign man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the Exclusion of the Citizens: and the Title of a Noble Venetian being Hereditary, such is also the being a Member of the Sovereignty. <hi>Genoa, Maltha, Ragusa,</hi> and some of the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> are govern'd according to the Laws of a Real Aristocracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Democracy,</hi> on the other side, is that which authorizes a Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. We have at this day several of this sort in <hi>Germany, Holland, Switzerland,</hi> and the Country of the <hi>Grisons.</hi> For altho' that these Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are govern'd after a different manner, nevertheless they are Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical for all that, with this Distinction, that some are better Regulated then the other. But in regard it is not our Business to enter, in this place, into an Examination of the Defects or Excellencies of either, we shall only tell you, That a Real and True Democratical Government is such a one, as wherein every thing being well manag'd for the Welfare and Advantage of the Publick, the Nobility has but a small part therein, being govern'd by Persons of Merit and Vertue, at least thought to be so, deputed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of the Cities and Provinces.</p>
               <p>Besides these Three sorts of Government, there are Two othes reckon'd into the Number, <hi>Despotick</hi> and <hi>Oligarchick;</hi> to which we may add a Third, and name it <hi>Lacedaemnian.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46341:4"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Despotick,</hi> gives an Absolute, Arbitrary, and Independant Power to the Prince, whose Will alone serves instead of a Law; and who, by virtue of that Will, may when he pleases deprive his Subjects of their Estates, as also of their Lives, without any Form of Process, or without any possibility of making any Defence against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> to speak properly, is no other then an Aristocracy administer'd by a small number of Persons, as Twenty, Thirty, or more, particularly made choice of. But these sorts of Government cannot long subsist; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the nearer they approach to the Degree of Sovereignty, the more easily they mount up to it, and the more they are tempted to it. For several Ages we have not had any Governments of this sort.</p>
               <p>The case is not the same with the Third sort of Government, which we have call'd <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> in reference to the manner after which the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> were govern'd. For they had a King; but his Authority was so small, that he could not undertake any thing of himself; besides, that he was responsible for his Actions to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who were indeed the Real So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns. Histories, both Ancient and Modern, furnish us with several of the same nature, among which, I shall make no scruple to number that of <hi>France.</hi> It being certain, that all the Kings of the First Race, and many of those of the Second and Third, were not Absolute in the Kingdom as now they are. 'Tis a thing well known to all the World. We have seen some of 'em more then once Depos'd by the States-General; not to mention the Authority of the Parlament, which far surpass'd that of the King's, and which was not utterly abolish'd till after the Ministry of Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu.</hi> The Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> are limited after the same manner. The first by the Parlament of the Kingdom, the second by the Dyets. However, these two Governments are not alike in all things, for that the one allows a more extended Power then the other.</p>
               <p>Among all the Kingdoms of this sort, the most Extraordinary, in my Opinion, was that of <hi>Arragon</hi> in former Times. The People of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, after they had shook off the Yoke of the Infidels, and re-conquer'd their own Country, made choice of a King to rule over 'em, who was Don <hi>Garcia Ximenes,</hi> a Gentleman of a Good Family, to whom they gave the Crown; but upon such severe Conditions, that we do not remember ever to have heard of the like. For they not only subjected him to the States-General of the Country, who might Depose him when they pleas'd, but they set over him a Chief-Justice, whom they call'd <hi>El Justitia,</hi> who could not be Condemn'd for any Crime, whatever it were, but by the States of the Country. This Minister was the Conservator of the Laws which they made at the same time, and which they call'd by the Name of <hi>La-Vajon;</hi> which contain'd little else only some Regulations to prevent the ambitious Designs of their King, and to bind his Hands in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he could make no Attempt upon their Liberty. The two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Articles were, <hi>That if the King went about to violate their Privileges, they might chuse another, either of the same or another Family; nay, though he were a Pagan, if they thought it convenient.</hi> The Second was, <hi>That, if he wrong'd any Subject or Vassal, the Nobles of the Country being assembl'd together, might confiscate his Revenue till he had satisfy'd the Party injur'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46341:5"/>
               <p>Besides that, they fram'd an Oath reciprocal between the King and themselves; which was to be taken after this manner. The Chief Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary being seated upon a Throne, the King came and kneel'd before him, without either Sword, Cap, or Girdle; and in that humble Posture swore to observe the Law, <hi>La-Vajon,</hi> together with all the Privileges which it gave to the <hi>Arragonians.</hi> And these were the peculiar Terms which they made use of; <hi>We that are of Equal Value with your self, make You our King and Lord, upon Condition that you observe our Laws and Privileges; and if not, not.</hi> This Law remain'd in full force till the Reign of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> sirnamed <hi>El Punal,</hi> who not being able to digest this Custom, never left till by his Intreagues he had got so strong a Party on his side, that the Law <hi>La-Vajon</hi> was abrogated by the Assembly of Estates; and the Original being deliver'd into his Hands, he cut it to pieces with his Poniard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, at the same time, he stabb'd himself into the Arm, saying, That 'twas but fit a Law so injurious to Kings should be obliterated by the Blood of a King: and for that reason he was sirnam'd <hi>El Punal.</hi> His Statue also is still standing in the Publick Hall of the Deputation at <hi>Saragossa,</hi> holding a Poniard in one Hand, and the Arragonian Privileges in the other, which appears wounded with the Blow that he gave himself. From that time forward the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> were no longer Elective, nor depended upon the Nobility. However, the Officer call'd by the Name of <hi>El Justicia,</hi> still remains, and that Employment is one of the most Noble in <hi>Spain.</hi> He that enjoys it, takes cognizance of all Suits and Complaints against the Judges of the Kingdom; and Condemns 'em to Death, if he finds that they have given an Illegal and Unrighteous Sentence. A Custom which cannot be too much applauded, and which ought to be observ'd in all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulated Governments. This would be a means to stop the Course of so much Injustice as is committed in the Palace; it being certain, that there are but too many Judges over whom sordid Interest prevails to that degree, that they care not what Mischief they doe. Besides, that it wou'd oblige 'em to decide a Suit in Law at least within a Year, which is a time sufficient to understand the Merits of a Cause, unless where Witnesses are far remote in Foreign Parts. Is it not a thing that cries for Vengeance from Heaven, to see poor Families ruin'd by the Charges of the Barr, and drill'd on from one wrangling Quirk to another, for Threescore and ten or Fourscore Years together? Yet there is nothing more common, particularly in <hi>France;</hi> and we could cite Ten Examples for One, were it requisite. But we shall return to our first Discourse.</p>
               <p>I am apt to believe that we have clearly enough demonstrated what are the different kinds of Government that have been in use till this present, and which are still at this day practis'd in the World. But there remains one difficult Question to be decided, which in all Ages has exercis'd the Wits and Arguments of Politicians. That is to say, Which of all these Governments is to be Preferr'd the one before the other, and which is most Advantageous to the Publick? A Question that as yet has never been clearly resolv'd, some holding for Monarchy, others siding with the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican; and even these are divided among themselves into different Parties. We shall not undertake to determin a Question so dubious as this, wherein
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46341:5"/> the <hi>Pro</hi>'s and <hi>Con</hi>'s are upheld by so many Reasons. Nevertheless, for the Satisfaction of the Reader, who probably will be willing to know our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, we shall deliver what we think upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Despotick Government,</hi> the most Odious of all, as that which authorizes all manner of Injustice, Vexations and Cruelties, would however most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be that, which without the least Hesitation we should preferr before all others, if all Kings were <hi>Solomons,</hi> such as of which Monsieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> gives us an <hi>Idea,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Counsels of Wisdom.</hi> But because, so far from that, the greatest part of Princes are Wicked and Sloathful, Soft and Effeminate, or easie to be Deluded, we must agree with all the World, That <hi>Despotick Government</hi> is Unjust, Tyrannical and Detestable.</p>
               <p>The Government purely <hi>Monarchical,</hi> which follows it close at the heels, is much more Mild and Equitable; yet after all, it is not the best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the too great Power of a Prince generally tempts him to degenerate into Despotick. Desire of Command being a Fire, that like the Rage of Avarice, never cries it has enough. This is no more then what God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to his People, when he gave 'em a King in his Wrath; <hi>He will have the Tythes</hi> (says He) <hi>of your Crops and your Vintage, and will give them to his Eunuchs and his Servants. And he will take your Men-servants and your Maid-servants, and your goodliest Young-men, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your Sheep, and ye shall be his Servants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Prophecy has been but too truly fulfill'd, and the History of past Ages sufficiently testifies, or rather we find verify'd in our days. Not that we would be thought to believe that all Kings are animated with the same Spirit. We would not do that Injury to Royal Majesty: nor are we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that there have been and still are most Excellent Princes, who far from extending their Power beyond the Bounds of Law, confine themselves within very narrow Limits. But in conclusion, the Number of them is but small, in comparison of the Others. Sovereign and Arbitrary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a Delicious Morsel which it is a difficult thing for frail Man to curb himself from Tasting, when it is only his fault if he do not: and some there be who pretend to that Equity and Moderation which otherwise they would not do, were their Strength but answerable to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
               <p>Neither should <hi>Aristocracy</hi> be the Government we would make choice of. There is nothing in it but the Shadow of Liberty, where not only the Citizens but the Noblemen live in terrible Slavery. 'Tis true, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meddles not with their Estates, which I must acknowledge to be a great Point, but it will not permit 'em to expend their Estates as they please themselves: for the Government calls the Subject to such a vexatious Account, that it regulates their very Apparel, their Servants, the Furniture of their Houses, their Attendants, and prescribes 'em ev'n what People they must visit, and what Company they must keep. Reckon moreover the continual Fear they are in of speaking, before a Spye, of an Inquisitor of State, or of the Church, who, upon his single Information, is able to cause the Hanging or Drowning of the Best Man in the City. Nevertheless, these Inconveniencies, from which no body is exempt in <hi>Venice,</hi> from the Duke himself to the meanest Gondoleer, are nothing in comparison of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46341:6"/> same Dependency of the Third Estate upon the Nobility. They are greater then can be well imagin'd; so that a Citizen, how Wealthy soever he be, dares not abide in his Country, if an Ordinary Nobleman have an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or but a slight Quarrel against him. Insomuch, that instead of One Sovereign, he meets with Seven or Eight hundred before whom it behoves him to creep and cringe. 'Tis true, that in Recompence of this, they are permitted to keep as many Courtesans, and as publickly as they please; and that they are allow'd, at certain times, to run about in Masque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade. This is the Liberty which the <hi>Venetians</hi> so highly boast of, and which they many times so insolently brag of, with a <hi>Where else, if not at Venice?</hi> Nevertheleless, we do believe they are not envy'd for it by many worthy People. However, we must not say, that these hard Laws which the Senate imposes upon their Subjects, are a sufficient Reason for the absolute condemning of Aristocratical Government, which is Mild of it self, and only render'd Severe and Harsh by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Yet they have done no more then what they could not dispense with doing, if they intended to prevent Quarrels and Disorders. These ponderous Laws are they that have establish'd their Republick upon the same Foundations on which they fix'd it above Twelve hundred Years ago; and which are so essential to this sort of Government, that without 'em it could not long subsist.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Democracy,</hi> we shall not say much of it, as being a Government that was never well receiv'd into this World. For though <hi>Otanes,</hi> in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> recommends it to the Persians, <hi>Propter illam Isonomiam,</hi> or <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatem Juris,</hi> that, as he says, attends it; yet <hi>Megabysus,</hi> in answer to him, explodes it. For says he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Nothing is more Sottish nor more Insolent then the Popular Multitude. What a King does, he acts with Advice and Knowledge. But 'tis the Property of the Multitude to understand nothing. For how should they who never were Taught, nor knew any thing of what was Noble and Decent ev'n in their own Families, understand what belongs to Government of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms? running headlong upon Business like a Torrent. They therefore that wish Evil to the Persians, let them make use of a Popular Government.</hi> As for those that extoll Democracy upon the account of the Jewish Polity, they are vainly mistaken. For the Jewish Government was indeed the purest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in the World, call'd therefore by our best Divines <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasie,</hi> govern'd under God their Supreme Sovereign, by his two Vicegerents, <hi>Moses</hi> in Temporals, and <hi>Aaron</hi> in Spirituals; only with this Distinction, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was subordinate to <hi>Moses;</hi> besides, that the Judges were single Persons. Moreover, we read in Sacred History, That <hi>the Princes of the Tribes apply'd themselves to</hi> Moses; <hi>The Princes of the Tribes contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Expences of the Ark,</hi> &amp;c. Expressions that no way agree with a <hi>Democracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> if they pretend to imitate the Exemplar of the Jewish Form, most certainly those States are far from being regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to their Maxims. More-especially the <hi>Switzers</hi> have the greatest need in the World of being Reform'd; and this I leave to the Judgment of all Men that have been there. In some Cantons the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty remains in the Hands of a small number of Inhabitants, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46341:6"/> to be the only Burgesses and only Lords. In others, on the other side, the most Important Affairs are decided in the open Field, by Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Voices of an Ignorant Rabble, who many times understand nothing of the Affair in Question. Thus it is that they consult of Peace and War, of raising Money, and of all things in General, and which is more miserable, out of this Popular Riffraff it is that they make choice of Envoys and Deputies that are to sit in their General Dyets, and treat of publick Business in behalf of their Cantons. So that there is nothing more usual then to see Shoemakers and Ploughmen in those great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, who bring their Children to wait upon 'em as their Servants.</p>
               <p>It now remains to examine that Government, which we have said to be of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Kind, which is neither Republican, nor truly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial, but is a mixture both of the One and the Other. Nor do we know any Kind more Excellent then this. It is usually accompany'd with Liberty enough. The Nobility Enjoy those Priviledges which are due to their Birth, and yet the third Estate is no way Excluded from Business. And they who believe that the Majesty of a King becomes a Kingdom, find wherewithal to content themselves; besides that, really and truly a King is most necessary upon a thousand Occasions, but more particularly in War and in Battels. It being certain that his Presence enlivens the Officers and Soldiers, and that it will avail much more then all his Generals. For which reason, the first Maxim that we believe useful for a King, is to look after his own Business himself, remembring an Old Proverb very frequent among Merchants, <hi>That he who does his Business by a Deputy, goes to the Hospital in Person.</hi> Not, that we are of their Opinion, who would have a Prince expose himself like a Common Soldier, or that he should charge with his Sword in his Hand at the Head of his Squadrons; that can never be proper, but when all lies at stake, and when there is a necessity either of dying or vanishing, to avoid an otherwise inevitable ruine. But unless it be upon such an Exigency, it behoves a Prince to be sparing of himself, and not slightly to venture a Life, which concerns the welfare of so many People, and upon which depends the Safety of a Country. And let the World say what it pleases, we never esteem'd the King of <hi>France</hi> the worse for always keeping himself without the Reach of Gunshot. 'Tis not for a Victorious Prince to try all sorts of Adventures. A Bare Gentleman may meet with Honour and his Fortune in such hazards, but the Risco's of a Monarch are quite another thing. His good Fortune consists in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Affairs himself in his Cabinet, to dive into every particular that concerns Policy and War, to command his Armies in Person, to issue forth his Orders, and take care that they be faithfully and couragiously put in Execution.</p>
               <p>This is what ought to be done, and what the King of <hi>France</hi> has done And if he had not sully'd so many Excellent Endowments with a fatal Ambition of Dominion, and building his Power upon that of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, it may be, he might be compar'd with the Greatest of Christian Princes that ever Reign'd. But this same Passion that has transported him to put all <hi>Europe</hi> into Disorder and Combustion, contrary to the Law of Nations, and the Faith of Treaties, will much Eclipse the Lustre of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46341:7"/> Glory in future Ages, and will leave him no other Parallel but what may be made between him and a Pagan Prince, who look'd upon the Rights of Conquest and Convenience to be Sufficient and Legal. Nevertheless, the Confederate Princes have had the Patience for several Years to see this puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Enemy of their Liberty continue his Conquests, at a time when it would have been no hard matter to have put a stop to his Career; every one perhaps believing that the Tempest would not fall upon Him; as if their Neighbours House could be burnt, and yet their own receive no damage. But at length, thanks be to Divine Providence that watches over the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Nations, they have open'd their Eyes to see the danger that threatens 'em. They are become sensible of the Ambitious Designs of that haughty Puissance, and have put themselves into a Condition to stem their Impetuosity. Nevertheless, we cannot forbear saying, that they stay'd till the last Extremity, and that had the League been delay'd but ne'er so little longer, the Opportunity would have been elaps'd. The King of <hi>France</hi>'s Aim was neither upon this or that Province, but upon the Empire, upon all <hi>Europe,</hi> upon the Universal Monarchy. This was the Mark he drove at, and which he had labour'd for so many Years. 'Twas the Conjecture of the Politicians fifteen or twenty Years ago, but now 'tis plainly seen and understood, nor do the <hi>French</hi> themselves dissemble it. All the Books that have been written at <hi>Paris</hi> for this seven or eight Years, and the Verses that have been there dispers'd abroad, are full of the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks of this future Monarchy.</p>
               <p>One of the King's Geographers, well known, has made no scruple to place him in the Number of Emperors of <hi>Europe,</hi> in a Treatise of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy which he publish'd within this little while, which doubtless was not done without Order. However let us suppose the Contrary, and that all that has been publish'd in <hi>France,</hi> was done unknown to the King; nay, let us acknowledge that he knew nothing of the Medal which was coin'd some Years ago, wherein he was represented with an Eagle upon his Head: Yet what Interpretation will they give to that same Insupportable Pride wherewith he treated all Soveraigns? Not one was Exempted, no not the Pope himself, to whom he sent a Person to out-brave him upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Chair, that carry'd himself more like an Insolent Victor then an Embassador, and who acted the King above a Year, even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self. How superbly did the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> declare in the King's Name to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> that he would look upon all those as his Enemies, that should undertake to oppose him in the Business of <hi>Cologne.</hi> Could any Man act more like a Soveraign upon that Occasion? And was not the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Principal Electorates upon his Creatures a subjecting both the Emperor and Empire. Add to this the Soveraign Court of <hi>Mentz,</hi> before which there was no Scruple made of citing all manner of Princes, nor of giving forth Decrees of Disseizen against 'em, which afterwards were put in Execution by force of Arms in time of Peace.</p>
               <p>Let us also reflect upon the manner how he tyranniz'd over the poor <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses,</hi> whom he forc'd to alter their Municipal Laws, to the end they might send their Duke into <hi>France</hi> to make him satisfaction, and that he might be Duke himself as well at <hi>Paris</hi> as at <hi>Genoua,</hi> condemning 'em to a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46341:7"/> a Fine of a Hunder'd thousand Crowns a Week, in case they fail'd to send him. If this were not acting like a universal Monarch, I confess I do not understand the Signification of the Term. This is then a thing sufficiently prov'd, or rather generally known, that the King of <hi>France</hi>'s design was no less then to invade the Territories of his Neighbours, that he might possess the One, exclude the Others, and keep the rest under the Fealty and Homage which a Vassal owes to his Soveraign and Lawful Lord. It only remains to examine whether his Projects are in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that may be call'd Chimerical and Imaginary, wherein there is no probability of Success, or whether his Forces are not much greater then we imagin'd 'em to be, and may not give us some reason to be afraid as well of our own, as the Liberties of our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>This is a very nice Subject: for the Publick is now adays come to that pass, that it will not be disabus'd; were they within half a Foot of Ruine, for a Man to shew 'em the Danger, and the means to avoid it, is not the way to please 'em; like Children, they are offended with those that snatch 'em from the Brink of danger: and they are better satisfy'd with the Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of petty Pamphlets, and the Dispersers of rascally Jests, and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ballads, that are always for singing Victory and Triumph, and that frequently too, when there is the least Occasion for it. As for our selves that profess Sincerity, we are so far from disguising our Sentiments, that we shall speak with the Freedom and honest Liberty of a good Citizen.</p>
               <p>It is too certain, that considering the Condition of Affairs after the Battel of <hi>Landen,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> with his own Forces, and which is more, with his Fortune, upon which in imitation of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he has much more rely'd, then upon all the Rest, might have extended his Conquests a great way, and if he could not have attain'd to the End of his Designs, at least he might have come very near it. The <hi>Low Countries</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> lay absolutely open, as every Body knows: So that had he made himself Master of those Places, what could have hinder'd him from entring <hi>Holland</hi> and carrying all before him, as he did in 1672. But luckily for us the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Affairs is chang'd since that time. The King of <hi>France</hi> has been constrain'd to reform a good Number of his Cavalry, for want of Horses to mount 'em, and Money to pay his Troops. On the Other side, the Confederates have so considerably augmented their Forces both by Sea and Land; that the Dauphin with all his Courage has been forc'd to lie Entrench'd during a whole Campaign, and the <hi>French</hi> Fleet has been wedg'd up in <hi>Toulon,</hi> not daring so much as to shew it self, while <hi>Diep, Haure</hi> and <hi>Honfleur,</hi> suffer'd the same hard Usage as <hi>Genoa, Liege</hi> and <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroi</hi> had receiv'd before from the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Prosperous Beginnings are good Prognosticks of a Happy Issue: thanks be to God Things are now in a good Posture; and provided the Confederates continue stedfast in their Union, not only the Words of that Medal which M. <hi>Van Bunninghen</hi> ascribes to 'em,<note place="margin">Sta Sole</note> may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd by their Valour, but by a greater Miracle it may be their good hap to force the Radiant Sun of <hi>France</hi> to a sudden Retrogradation.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, there is no falling asleep upon these favourable Hopes, as if God or Fortune were to doe all; New Efforts are still requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46341:8"/> and a Restless Prosecution till the End be attain'd, which was first propos'd at the Beginning of the War. This is the Duty of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. That of Private Persons is freely to open their Purses, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their Abilities whenever they may prove useful to the Publick. With which Design it is that we have undertaken this Work, which we have publish'd to the World as as Mark of our Zeal for the General Cause. For, in regard the King of <hi>France,</hi> as Bold an Invader as he is, endeavours how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to colour his Usurpations under Specious Pretences, which he would never want, tho' he should extend his Conquests to the End of the World; we thought it would be a labour no way unacceptable or unprofitable to the Publick, to set forth an Abstract of the Claims which either he has, or pretends to have to the Dominions of the Confederates; that so they who are ignorant of 'em, may truly inform themselves, and prevent their being deluded by <hi>Manifesto's,</hi> which utter any thing that makes for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0. To this <hi>Pharamond</hi> it is that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the <hi>Salick Law</hi> is ascrib'd, so call'd, according to some, from the Word <hi>Isala,</hi> which was formerly the Name of a River; because, say they, it was made in <hi>Trans-Issalania,</hi> now <hi>Over-Issel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others assert it to have been made in <hi>Taxandria,</hi> a Country depending formerly partly upon <hi>Brabant,</hi> and partly upon the Bishoprick of <hi>Liege.</hi> Some Authors are of opinion that it was so call'd, because it was written in the <hi>Salle</hi> or Great Hall where the King held his Council. And several derive the Name of it from the Word <hi>Salick,</hi> which in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Language signifies <hi>wholesome,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, which in many Places were entitul'd <hi>Leges Salutares.</hi> But we rather think it proper to prefer before this Opinion, that other which maintains that this same famous Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Etymology of its Name from the <hi>Salians,</hi> or <hi>Salii,</hi> a People that inhabited along the River <hi>Sal,</hi> who were the Founders of it, and were govern'd by it. But afterwards, when they remov'd into <hi>Gaul,</hi> they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd the Name of <hi>Franks,</hi> in Opposition to that Servitude, under which the Emperors had held all <hi>Europe</hi> for so long a time; however they still preserv'd their Law. This is the same which the <hi>French</hi> pretend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve at this Day; and which they quote upon all Occasions with an Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for which they have but very little ground: seeing that after all the Enquiry which the Learned have made into this Matter, they could never yet discover any thing of Certainty concerning it. There are many likewise who condemn it for Apocryphal: nevertheless, the Messieurs <hi>Pithou</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46341:8"/>
                     <hi>Bignon</hi> have given us some while since, a kind of Formulary of it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Assemblage of Articles, which they have collected and raked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of several Authors: a Plentiful Spring from whence to draw a great many things, were it not but that the Times are so remote.</p>
                  <p>The two pretended Articles of this Law are these; the one Excluding Females from Inheriting the Crown; and the other to prevent the Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Royal Demesnes.</p>
                  <p>The First, say they, ran in these Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the</hi> Salick <hi>Land let no Portion of Inheritance descend to the Female, but let the Male Sex enjoy the Possession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Substance of the Second is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No</hi> Salick <hi>Land can be alienated from the Total, but shall remain united to it, Inseparable to Perpetuity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Title that <hi>Golstadius</hi> gives us of 'em is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These are the</hi> Salick <hi>Laws of</hi> Pharamond <hi>the First King of the</hi> Franks, <hi>formerly decreed by the People and their Lords in the Sates of Salize.</hi> And in the Margin he interprets the <hi>States of Salize, Saltzburg</hi> upon the River <hi>Sal,</hi> in <hi>Franconia.</hi> But Authors so ill agree upon the Time, the Place when and where this Law was made, the Articles which it contains, and the General Title it self, that there is nothing to be positively ascertain'd. The Collection which we have of 'em at this Day, is entitul'd <hi>La Pact de la loy Salique.</hi> The Compact of the <hi>Salick</hi> Law. It contains 80 Heads, among which, that of Free Tenures in the Sixth Head is that above-cited, for the Exclusion of Females. Nor do the French make a less noise about that which concerns Inalienation; and because the Kings of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Meroveus</hi> to <hi>Charlemaign</hi> were extreamly Potent, and held under their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion a good part of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> they pretend at this Day that those Countries were Demesnes of the Crown, which according to the Fundamental Law of the Kingdom could not be alienated. Add to this, that <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was made Emperor, and the Empire declar'd to be an Inheritance founded in his Person and the Persons of his Successours. And in regard the <hi>Carlovingian</hi> Race ended in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Death of <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> they pretend that the Imperial Diadem ought to return to <hi>Charles the Simple,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> whose Person they represent and have the same Claims. By vertue of which, several of their Predecessours have assum'd the Title of Emperours, as <hi>Philip</hi> I. <hi>Lewis the Gross,</hi> and <hi>Lewis the Young,</hi> who always bare in their Escutcheons a Spread-Eagle, charg'd with <hi>France.</hi> And it may be for this reason it is, that the three last Kings have all along assum'd at the Ottoman Court the Title of <hi>Emperors of the French,</hi> believing that to be a sufficient Challenge of their Claim; for that they make no Scruple to give out, that the Empire is a Dependance belonging to their Crown.</p>

                     </gap>s into the Pretensions of <hi>France</hi> to the Empire.</head>
                  <p>THese Pretensions are so Chimerical, that we could hardly resolve to insert 'em here. But in regard that <hi>France</hi> her self insists upon 'em, we thought it convenient to give some Account of 'em among others, of which we shall find a great many that are no better grounded. We agree that the Empire was settl'd and founded Hereditary in the Person of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaign</hi> and his Successours. And indeed he would but little have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his own Interests, had he accepted it upon other Conditions; He who had conquer'd with his Sword the Greatest part of the Countries that Compos'd it, and who had restor'd the Pope, and invested him in a very Considerable Territory. 'Tis likewise true, that after the Death of <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> the Empire was naturally to return to <hi>Charles the Simple</hi> his Cousin and presumptive Heir. But what then? Because a Revolution, very frequent in Kingdoms, has remov'd the Empire of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and depriv'd a Prince that was no way capable of it, to give it to another who better deserv'd it; is it a Thing reasonable or agreeable to Conscience for a Man to revive at this Day Claims that have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in an Oblivion of about seven Centuries? During which, the Empire has not only admitted New Constitutions with the Consent of the Popes, and by the Advice of the States Assembl'd, but also has accounted <hi>France</hi> among her Demesnes, and has receiv'd the Homages due for 'em, as we shall make appear in the sequel of this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Salick</hi> Law, upon which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> so strongly build in their own Imaginations, we have already told you what it is. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story testifies, that the most Ancient Kings, next to <hi>Pharamond</hi> who was the Founder of it, have dispos'd of their Kingdoms in a manner altogether opposite to those pretended Constitutions. <hi>Charlemaign</hi> gave <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> his Brother; and <hi>Lewis the Debonair,</hi> his Son, divided his Empire among his three Children, making one Emperor, the other King of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the third King of <hi>France.</hi> Which makes us justly doubt, whether Inalienation were truly one of the Articles of that Law. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Exclusion of the Females, we shall say nothing at all of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there has been no occasion known, whereby the Daughters could pretend to the Crown. But if the First Head be not Essentially Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, there is as little probability that the other should be so. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed till after the Death of <hi>Charles the Fair,</hi> there was no talk of the <hi>Salick</hi> Law, neither in whole, nor in part; nor did they ever bethink themselves of quoting it, but only to exclude <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who claim'd, in right of his Grandmother <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip the Fair.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, he had a numerous Party that stood for him; and if he had not been a Foreigner, certain it is, that he would have been acknowledg'd, seeing, that notwithstanding that Objection, he had such a fair Reputation in the Country, as for a long time to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Opinions of the French Lords in the Assembly of Estates held at <hi>Senlis.</hi> But the Bishop of <hi>Beauvois,</hi> who oppos'd the King of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:46341:9"/> rising up of a sudden, and rehearsing that Passage in the Gospel, <hi>Videte Lilia agri, qui neque laborant nequenent;</hi>
                     <q>Ha! Messieurs, (said he,) God would this day give us to understand by his Gospel, what your Lordship's Decision ought to be in this case. The <hi>Lillies labour not, neither do they spin;</hi> as much as to say, that the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by the Lillies, ought not to encircle the Head of a Woman.</q>— These Words wrought so effectually, that immediately the Assembly resolv'd upon the Exclusion of <hi>Edward,</hi> in favour of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois;</hi> who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd King; and who, in Memory of that Accident, took for his Motto the very Words which the Bishop had made use of. And from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this day, the Kings his Successors have all along preserv'd this Custom; and by length of Time, have made it a Municipal Law not to be disputed against 'em. Now this Law can only take place among Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon whom their Kings impose what Yoaks they please; and not among Sovereign-Princes, who acknowledge no Superiors but Justice and Reason. And in regard they require, that when Treaties of Alienation are made between Sovereigns, whether by Renunciation, Assignment, Deed of Gift, or Right of Dowry, whatever was promis'd, should be sincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd on both sides, such Pretensions will be always sufficient to authorize the Right of Possession; and it is in vain for the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Treaties, to alledge, That upon the Day of their Coronation they swore never to make any Alienations from the Crown. This would be good reason to excuse 'em from Treating; but when the thing is once done, there's no recalling Word and Deed. 'Tis their Misfortune if they are perjur'd: it behov'd 'em to be more careful; or rather, not to swear to a thing which they knew it was not in their Power to perform. As for Foreign Princes, 'tis no business of theirs to trouble themselves with these Scruples, or to take notice what the King of <hi>France</hi> has sworn; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they seek their own Advantages by only lawful Means, no Blame can light upon them. We say, moreover, that this same Oath carries in it self a Character of Iniquity, since it only tends to swallow up all the Dominions in the World, one after another. There is in it an inordinate and boundless Avarice and Ambition, altogether remote from the Spirit of Christianity. It may be properly call'd, Swearing to devour the Estates and Territories of other Men, and never to restore 'em. And indeed, do we not find that <hi>France</hi> extends her Pretensions almost over all the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Europe?</hi> and that she is not asham'd to put the Roman Empire, which, according to the Order establish'd for several Ages, has always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided over all the rest of the Kingdoms in this Quarter of the World, in the Number of her Provinces, and among the Demesnes of her Crown? After all this, we have no more to say, but that in all probability, the Spirit with which this Court is enliven'd, will never change.</p>

                  <p>ABout the Year 710. the <hi>Moors</hi> coming out of <hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd all <hi>Spain,</hi> meeting hardly with any body that oppos'd 'em, unless it were two Princes; the one of which, nam'd <hi>Pelagius,</hi> founded a small Kingdom which he call'd <hi>Oviedo,</hi> now <hi>Leon.</hi> He also made himself Master of another petty Country upon the Frontiers of his Kingdom, to which he gave the Title of a <hi>County,</hi> and built several Castles therein to secure it from the Invasions of the <hi>Moors,</hi> from whence it was call'd <hi>Castille.</hi> These two Provinces remain'd under the Dominion of the Heirs of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> till the Year 814. that Don <hi>Alphonso;</hi> King of <hi>Oviedo,</hi> and Count of <hi>Castille,</hi> sirnam'd the <hi>Chast,</hi> because he liv'd a Chast and Religious Life, finding he had no Children by his Wife <hi>Bertha,</hi> made <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the Emperor and King of <hi>France,</hi> his Heir; to whom he sent an Embassie of the most Noble Lords of his Kingdom to present him with his Will, and to intreat his Acceptance of it.</p>
                  <p>Several Reasons, say the Historians, engag'd Don <hi>Alphonso</hi> to leave his Dominions, after his Death, to <hi>Charlemain.</hi> First they were united by the Ties of a very strict Friendship. Besides, he was a Christian Prince, and the only Prince in his time who was able to protect the Church, which was oppress'd by the Infidels in those Countries after a very cruel manner. But, in my Opinion, the most enforcing Reason of all, was that of Necessity, which oblig'd Don <hi>Alphonso</hi> to call in <hi>Charlemain</hi> to his Aid. For he had not only groan'd a long time under the Tyranny of the <hi>Moors,</hi> but he found himself in great danger of being Dispossess'd by <hi>Hisen Miramolin,</hi> who would constrain him to send every Year Fifty Noble Virgins, and as many Damsels of the Meaner sort; which <hi>Murgas</hi> his Predecessor had been enforc'd to pay him, not to mention the vast Summs which he extorted from him every Day, nor the Authority which he exercis'd in his Kingdom to his Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Such was the Servitude to which <hi>Alphonso</hi> was reduc'd, without any hopes of being deliver'd but by the Assistance of <hi>Charlemain;</hi> who, though a great Protector of the Faith, was not so kind natur'd neither, as to give it him for nothing. No wonder then, if at such a Conjuncture, <hi>Alphonso</hi> rather chose to subject himself to a Dependency upon a Christian Emperor, and to bequeath him his Kingdom after his Death, then to see it usurp'd by the <hi>Moors</hi> during his Life-time, and run the risco of their barbarous Usage to boot. However it were, <hi>Charles the Great</hi> came into <hi>Spain</hi> with an Army of 140000 Men, accompany'd with the Choice of the French Nobility, who flockt to that War, some out of a Motive of Honour, others for the sake of Religion; for those Wars were accounted Holy, and the Ministers preach'd 'em up for such, as afterwards they preach'd up the Croisades. This War lasted Fourteen Years; at the end of which, all <hi>Spain</hi> being reduc'd, <hi>Charles</hi> was acknowledg'd Sovereign, and they brought him the Fire and Water, according to the Custom which was anciently observ'd.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46341:10"/>
                  <p>Upon this Donation it is, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ground their first Claim to <hi>Castille,</hi> as <hi>Charlemain's</hi> Successors, from whom they pretend to be descended; which we shall not dispute with 'em, though their Filiation be not so clearly made out, as having no other Warrant for it but the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Sens,</hi> the Sentiments of <hi>Cujas,</hi> and a Letter of Pope <hi>John</hi> VIII. written in the Year 872. to Abbot <hi>Hugh,</hi> the Brother of Marquis <hi>Robert;</hi> wherein he tells him that he is, <hi>ex Regali pro sapia editus.</hi> However, after the Death of Don <hi>Alphonso,</hi> Don <hi>Ramira,</hi> and D. <hi>Garcia,</hi> his Nephews, suceeeded him. But in a short time after they were gone, the Government chang'd; for the <hi>Castillians,</hi> provok'd by their King <hi>Friulla,</hi> who had usurp'd the Crown from his Nephews, rebell'd, and set up Two Sovereign Judges, <hi>Nuga Rasura,</hi> and <hi>Flavin Calvo,</hi> and the Kingdom remain'd in that Posture from the Year 896. to 937. At what time Don <hi>Sanches,</hi> King of <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> suppress'd the Authority of the Judges. He was the first that erected <hi>Castille</hi> into a Sovereign Country, which happen'd after a particular manner. A certain Lord, whose Name was Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> coming to the Court of Don <hi>Sanches,</hi> sold him a Horse and Goshawk, both perfect Creatures in their Kind: and in regard the King could not pay him down ready Money, and for that he had a great desire to have the Hawk and the Horse, he agreed for a very high Price, payable at a certain time, with this Condition, That if the King did not pay the Money by the Time, he should double the Principal and Interest every Month. The Money therefore not being pay'd, it so happen'd, that two Years after the Expiration of the Term, the Summ became so vast, that all the Gold in the Kingdom was not sufficient to discharge it. Which induc'd Don <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to erect <hi>Castille</hi> into a Free and Independent County or Earldom, and to give it in Payment to Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who by that means enjoy'd a Sovereignty in Exchange for a Horse and Goshawk, which he possess'd, both himself and his Posterity, till the Yeaar 1028. At what time it was annex'd to the Crown of <hi>Navarr,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Nuga,</hi> the only Sister and Heiress of Don <hi>Garcia,</hi> the last Count of <hi>Castille,</hi> with <hi>Sancho</hi> IV. King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> who erected it afterwards into a Kingdom, which he gave to his Son <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. the First King of <hi>Castille.</hi> After whom among other Kings, reign'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and his Son <hi>Alphonso</hi> IX. who marry'd <hi>Leonora,</hi> or <hi>Eleonar,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>England;</hi> by whom he had Seven Children, <hi>Blanch,</hi> Queen of <hi>France; Berengera,</hi> marry'd to Don <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi> King of <hi>Leon; Sancho,</hi> who dy'd an Infant; <hi>Ʋrache,</hi> Queen of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal; Leonora,</hi> Queen of <hi>Arragon; Constantia,</hi> a Nun; and <hi>Henry,</hi> who, after his Father, was King of <hi>Castille;</hi> but he reign'd but a short time, losing his Life by an unfortunate Accident in the flower of his Youth. For that lying at <hi>Palencia,</hi> in the Bishop's House, where he was taking his Pleasure with some hot-headed young Lords, one among the rest, whose Name was <hi>Mendosa,</hi> threw a Tile from the Top of a Tower, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the King's Head, broke his Scull, so that he dy'd in eleven Days after.</p>
                  <p>This unexpected Death of his, left all the Right of the Crown to <hi>Blanch,</hi> the Eldest Sister of <hi>Henry,</hi> who was marry'd to <hi>Lewis</hi> VIII. King of <hi>France.</hi> But her Sister <hi>Berengera</hi> being upon the Place, made a strong Party in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46341:11"/> the Kingdom, and sent D. <hi>Lopez de Haro,</hi> and Don <hi>Gonsalo de Torro,</hi> to seek out her Son, and bring him Home. But because she was afraid lest <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Leon,</hi> her Husband, should refuse to consent to this Usurpation, she enjoyn'd her Envoys to conceal the Death of <hi>Henry,</hi> and to say that 'twas <hi>Henry</hi> who sent for the Infant. Which Trick of hers succeeded so well, that they brought the young Prince along with 'em to <hi>Otelia;</hi> where <hi>Berengera</hi> caus'd him to be proclaim'd King, under an Elm, by some Persons assembl'd together for that purpose: and from thence he was conducted to <hi>Palencia,</hi> where he was receiv'd. However, the Greatest Part of the <hi>Castillians</hi> and the Grandees of the Kingdom would not acknowledge him, but assembling the States of the Kingdom, they deputed four of the most Eminent among 'em, to make their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the Original of their Letters are still to be seen in the Treasury of <hi>France.</hi> There were also some Governours of Cities, who declar'd for King <hi>Lewis</hi> VIII. King of <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi> King of <hi>Leon</hi> also, no way approving this Act of Injustice, betook himself to Arms against the <hi>Castillians,</hi> in favour of <hi>Blanch,</hi> who besides the Right of Eldership which naturally call'd her to the Crown, she or her Son had also on her side the Will of the deceased King her Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> who appointed <hi>Lewis</hi> Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> and his Nephew, for his Heir. Nevertheless all these special Titles could not hinder <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling himself upon the Throne of <hi>Castille,</hi> in such a manner, that never any Kings of <hi>France</hi> reign'd in that Kingdom. However from this <hi>Blanch,</hi> the Mother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> it is, that they deduce their best Pretensions to <hi>Castile:</hi> Let us now see whether they are of any Validity or no.</p>

                  <head>Enquiries into the Pretensions of <hi>France</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Castille.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BEfore we enter into the Discussion of these Pretensions, it will not be amiss to set forth in short what are the usual Titles, by vertue of which Princes reign over the Dominions and Territories under their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the end the Reader in the Sequel of this Treatise, may the more easily understand True Interests from False Ones.</p>
                  <p>We shall reduce'em then into Eight, which are the Principal Ones, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which are contain'd all the different Manners of acquiring Soveraign Power, as well Just and Lawful, as Illegal and Tyrannical.</p>
                  <p>The First is, Next Inheritance: the Second is Acquisition in right of Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: the Third, Donation: the Fourth, Purchase: the Fifth, Reversion: the Sixth, Renunciation by Treaties and Mutual Contracts. The Seventh, Possession; and the Eighth, Conquest and Usurpation.</p>
                  <p>Next Inheritance, that is to say, the Right of the nearest in Blood to the Succession, is the most just in the World, and has been acknowledg'd for such in all Times and among all Nations. In a word, there is nothing more Natural then for Children to possess the Estates in which they had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest while their Fathers were alive. For by the Law, <hi>Liberi non viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur novam hereditatem percipere, sed liberam Bonorum Administrationem Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequi.</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:46341:11"/> Which gave <hi>Salvian</hi> an Occasion to say, <hi>In domo Patris etiam In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes filii et filiae Dominuli &amp; Dominulae appellantur, ut arctandi non Videan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, qui pene ad bona propria veniunt ratione naturali, quasi quadam Lege Tacita Liberis Parentum hereditatem abdicente.</hi> Which is so true, that the Possession of Estates is never reckon'd to begin, but to continue in the Persons of the Children. <hi>Continuationem Domini Necessitatemque Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis esse ipso jure.</hi> The same is also to be said in respect of Collateral Succession, when the Person in Possession has no Children; for then the Inheritance naturally devolves to the next of Kin, whether Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; unless the Municipal Law has otherwise ordain'd, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> where only the Males have right to succeed to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>After Inheritance, there is no Title more legal then what a Man acquires by Marriage to the Estate of her whom he marries. For seeing that by the Institution of that Sacred Knot, the Woman puts her self under the Dominion and Power of the Husband, to whom she bequeaths her self, 'tis Evident that her Estate, which is of a Nature much Inferior to her Person, is subjected to him also, till Death happening, the Children of this Wedlock succeed to the Estates of both the One and the Other, which by that means become incorporated and united, unless for want of Issue the Estate of the Woman returns to the next of Kin.</p>
                  <p>Donation, to which we have given the third place among the Titles of Princes, 'tis without question a very just Title, according to that same Axiom, That nothing is better acquir'd then what is given. Nevertheless, that Donations may obtain their due Force and Validity, they must be made according to the Rules of Piety and Reason. For Example, It would not be just, for a Man to disinherit his Lawful Heirs out of a Humour or headstrong Obstinacy, to give his Estate to a Stranger. This in some measue would be to give away that which was none of his own; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that according to our Principle, Children have a right to the Estates of their Parents in their Life-time. Nor do's the known Law of the Land permit Private Persons to give away above a Third part of their Estate, to the Prejudice of their Heirs, but obliges 'em to be civilly accountable for their Children, till they have attain'd to Twenty five Years of Age. Which proves sufficiently that the Law looks upon 'em to be as it were the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Conservators of their Childrens Estates. However it is not to be thought that a Parent's Hands are so far bound, that he shall have no Power to satisfie his own bountiful Inclination, whether in respect of any particular Friend, or any other Person from whom he has receiv'd some Considerable Kindness. And hence it comes to pass, that besides his Goods and Chattels, the Law allows him to dispose of the Third part of his Real Estate. Now if the Law have granted this Priviledge to Private Persons, there is much more reason that Soveraigns should have the same Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; otherwise they would be more ty'd up then their Subjects, as being debarr'd the Means to exercise their Piety, their Liberality and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which are Vertues so Essential to Monarchs, thas without 'em they are distinguish'd from other Men but by those things which are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hateful: and it may be justly said of them, what the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> said of the Popes, that they were like Conjurers, who were able to do a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46341:12"/> great deal of Mischief, but no Good. But let us speak better things, and agree that it is Lawful for a Prudent, Pious and Grateful Prince, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to times and occasions, to make Donations, more especially when he finds that they concur with the Welfare of the People. Now there are two sorts of Donations; some are made during the Life of the Donor; others are Testamentary Bequests; which being firm and valid, as has been said, they who are in Possession by vertue of such Donations, are legally seiz'd of such Goods or Legacies.</p>
                  <p>Acquisition by purchase is also a very good Title. 'Tis so in respect of private Persons, whose Right to the Estates which they bought and pay'd for was never yet disputed; and we must allow it to be the same with Sovereigns, who it may well be thought would never yield to weaken themselves and lessen their Power and their Gandeur, were they not induc'd thereto by more then ordinary Motives. And the Validity of these sort of Alienations, as well as of all others, is doubly Authentick when the People give their Consent, which always appears by their Silence: it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that when they believe it not Convenient, they know which way to oppose it, and to protest that they will ne're be separated from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to which they are united, as twice it fell out under the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of <hi>France,</hi> after the Treaties at <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Cambray.</hi> However, certain it is, that the Purchaser, or the Person in whose favour the Sale, Donation, Testament or Resignation was made, has warrant sufficient to justifie and defend his Right against all those that would go about to dispossess him.</p>
                  <p>Reversion is without question the fairest Flower in the Crown of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and the Greatest Mark of Royal Majesty and Grandeur. For in short, when a Sovereign, upon the death of a Feudatarie Prince that does him Homage, enters upon his Lands, or else Invests another in 'em, does not this suppose that it was He who made him what he is? And is there any more apparent Mark of Supremacy, then to make Sovereigns and bestow Sovereignties? This is that which may be truly call'd Royal Majesty, and the Image of Divinity. 'Tis then the Right of Great Princes to dispose of the Provinces of their Feudataries when they have revolted from 'em, or when they dye without Issue. And though this Right belongs to Monarchs only, exclusively from all others, nevertheless the Law being desirous to distinguish the Nobl-men from the Peasants, has allow'd some part of this Priviledge to Feodal Lords, who by vertue of their Feifs succeed by right of Eschetage to the Estates of those that dye without Heirs, have their Rent-Services and Alienation-Fines pay'd 'em upon the change of every Proprietor, and assume to themselves the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation of Felons Goods and Estates; as if the Feif or Lordship were the Mass from which these Estates had been dismember'd, and were to be united again.</p>
                  <p>We speak not here but only of the Customs settl'd in the Lordships of <hi>France, England,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and some other Places: for we are not ignorant, that in <hi>Poland,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Privileges of Lords are much more extended: but in regard they are altogether Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46341:12"/> and contrary to Equity and Right Reason, we shall say nothing of 'em</p>
                  <p>The Rights which are drawn from Resignations, made and granted by Treaties of Peace or Alliance between Sovereign Princes, are no less Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and good then any of those before specify'd, tho' at this Day they are those which are the least regarded, the Greatest part of Princes looking upon Treaties only as indirect ways to attain their Ends, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that they are not oblig'd to observe 'em any longer then they serve their Turns: pernicious Maxims that occasion most bloody Wars and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of the People. And some there are who proceed to that Excess of Infidelity, that they never treat but only to gain time, and with a design to act afterwards contrary to what they have promis'd and sworn to. However, certain it is, that the Observance of Treaties is grounded upon the Laws of God and Man, which they most horribly violate, who falsifie their Publick Contracts. That the Observance of Treaties is grounded upon the Laws of God, is easie to prove out of Sacred Story, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the manner of the <hi>Israelites</hi> acting with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> tho' they had not dealt sincerely with them, but quite the contrary had given the <hi>Hebrews</hi> a fallacious account of Things. So that one would have thought they should not have held themselves bound to stand to the Agreement, more-especially seeing that reason of State and Religion seem'd to oblige 'em to break it, and exterminate that People as well as the rest: besides that they had all the reason in the world to fear their Rebellions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, supported by the Succours of their Neighbours, and the Pollutions of their Idolatry. Pretences sufficiently specious to have oblig'd 'em to break the Treaty. But in regard they had a sounder Idea of Publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements and Compacts then we have, they thought they could not break it with a safe Conscience, and rather chose to expose themselves to the Inconveniences above specify'd, then to falsifie their Faith with those Infidels, wherein they positively obey'd the Motions of the Spirit of God, who hath several times declar'd himself the Avenger of those who after they have treated with Sincerity, have unexpectedly been surpriz'd by their Enemies, tho' they themselves were Infidels. Witness <hi>Sultan Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who relying upon the Peace which <hi>Ladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> had solemnly sworn to, disbanded the Greatest Part of his Army. In the mean time <hi>Ladislaus</hi> over-rul'd by the Pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Cardinal <hi>Julian,</hi> who told him, That he was not oblig'd to keep his Word with a <hi>Turk,</hi> entred the Sultan's Dominions, when dreaming least of any such Thing, and having constrain'd him to come to a Battel with such Forces as he could get together of a sudden, <hi>Amurath</hi> doubtful of the Success, as the two Armies were just ready to engage, <hi>Behold Jesus Christ,</hi> said he with a loud Voice, <hi>behold thy Christians combin'd together to my Ruine in defiance of Treaties. See here the Peace concluded and sworn to by them with my self. They have Sworn to it by thy Deity, and they have falsify'd it by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and their foul Treachery. They acknowledg'd thee by their Oath, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thee by the Violation of it. Now therefore, if thou art a God, avenge thy self, avenge me upon these Perfidious People, and let 'em see they are not to go unpunish'd, who offend thy Deity.</hi> The Issue of this Invocation was, that with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46341:13"/> a Number of Men, much inferiour to that of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> he utterly defeated 'em, and <hi>Ladislaus</hi> being slain in the Battel, he pursu'd his Victory so effectually, that he made himself Master of the Greatest Part of the Kingdom. And indeed all the World knows that the Law of Nations is the Principal Foundation, and that which chiefly authorizes Treaties of Alliance, Peace, Truces, Resignation, Compensation, and generally all other Things. So that if henceforward they must be look'd upon as Songs, adieu publick Tranquility, 'tis to no purpose to make any more; and Men must resolve to live in perpetual Wars, in an Eternal Anarchy and a Confused Mixture of Robberies, Plunderings and all manner of Wrongs and Violences, as was to be seen in <hi>France</hi> all the while the Civil Wars lasted. Which is certainly the most terrible Misfortune that can befall a Kingdom. Since then Treaties are the Foundations of Publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon which every one relies, it must be agreed that there is nothing more Sacred, and that a Prince who violates 'em, is guilty before God and Man of all the Blood shed in the Wars, and of all the Miseries and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that attend upon 'em. And this is the Opinion of <hi>Baldus,</hi> who deems that Sovereign not worthy of his Crown, who refuses to observe not only the Treaties made by himself, but those also of his Predecessours. Nevertheless those Lawyers who have div'd into this Question, whether a Prince be oblig'd by the Treaties of him that reign'd before him, have made a distinction. For if a Kingdom be not Hereditary, they have left it to him that succeeds, either to observe, or not to observe 'em as he thinks fit. <hi>Quia in successione Juris not veniunt Obligationes defuncti.</hi> But if the Crown comes to him by Succession, they have decided the Point that he is bound by all the Treaties and Compacts of his Predecessour, and is ty'd to observe 'em as Religiously as he that made 'em. Which is also groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Disposal of Law, and the Constitutions of the Emperours, by which the Heir, as representing the Person of him that made 'em, is bound also to observe all the Contracts and Agreements which he made. <hi>Eo quod Heres in solidum defunctum representet, ex parte etiam pro parte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentet, &amp; pro partibus coheredum censeatur extraneus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have Enlarg'd a little the more upon the Subject of Treaties and Contracts, because upon them it is, that the Rights and Interests of those Princes concerning whom we are now to discourse, are in good part to be determin'd, and for that it is of great Importance that every Body may be sensible how sacred they are, and how highly that Prince offends who slights 'em as things of little value, since they are positively founded upon the Law of God, and the Law of Nations.</p>
                  <p>Let us now come to Possession, which is the Sixth and Last Legal Title which Princes may make use of to justifie their Dominion. Possession is a Title become just by Process of time, which renders that Legal, which Originally perhaps might not be so. This is that which all the Laws of the World are agreed upon, and have therefore fix'd a certain Time, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of which all sorts of Titles are determin'd, and the Possession is Legitimated; which is absolutely necessary to secure the Estate of every Man. For but for this, any Litigious Person might come with Old Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and disseize an unprovided Proprietor, who having lost his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46341:13"/> or by some other Accident, might not be in a Condition to defend his Right. And this would infallibly overturn the best Establish'd Families in the World, and open a Door to a world of Confusion and Disorder. The Law then did nothing but what is most just when it authoriz'd Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. But if this Constitution be extreamly beneficial to private Men, it may be said to be absolutely necessary for Soveraigns. For if they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree among themselves, the Publick will be sure considerably to suffer, and therefore 'tis of great Importance to remove all Occasions of their Disagreement.</p>
                  <p>However, in regard the Pretensions of Sovereigns are always of very great Moment, 'tis not just that they should be so narrowly prescrib'd as the Claims of Private Men. And therefore it is, that whereas for private Men, Thirty Years of Continu'd Possession suffices, in the Cases of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns and the Church, a Hunder'd Years are admitted: after which all Claims against the Possessour are determin'd to be Null and Void, and the Possession is adjudg'd Legal. This is the pure Law of Nations, against which there is no Contending without Brangling and Injustice; and it behoves all Princes in the World to submit to it, as they have all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously acknowledg'd except these Last Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who by vertue of an Obscure <hi>Salick</hi> Law, scarce known in the world, pretend, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was united to the Crown, ought either absolutely or of right be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable, and above all the Laws of Prescription, that under that pretence they may be enabl'd to justifie the Invasion of their Neighbours whenever they find an Opportunity. A thing which never made a noise till the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. who made an Edict, by which all manner of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, even those of a Hunder'd Years were declar'd of no Validity against him or the Demesnes of the Crown, and that they should be of no Force to Detain from him such Rights and Territories as depended upon him. And upon this Foundation it is, that the King of <hi>France</hi> at this Day reigning, believ'd himself to have a right to <hi>Strasburgh, Luxemburgh,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> as being Dependencies upon his Crown, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Treaties which he or his Predecessours had made, and by which they renounc'd their Right to those Places. But in regard this Claim is of no Force, First, because it is an Innovation; Secondly, because it could not be establish'd to the Prejudice of Princes and Sovereigns, who no way depend upon the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> they can never want Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in opposing it by Force of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The two last Titles which sometimes render Princes the Absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Countries, are Conquest and Usurpation; if Usurpation may be rank'd in the Number of Titles; for no Usurper ever acknowledg'd it to be a Title. Nevertheless, in regard it is many times one of the Means made use of to arrive at Sovereignty, tho' it may be call'd by another Name, and defin'd it in two Words, in saying, that by Usurpation, we mean the different Ways of appropriating to themselves the Estates of Others, whether by Intreigues or Cabals, by Force of Arms, or False-Titles.</p>
                  <p>Thus Conquest becomes a Real Usurpation, when it is not founded upon True and Solid Rights: nevertheless the <hi>Roman</hi> Church authorizes it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46341:14"/> against the Infidels <hi>pro propaganda fide,</hi> provided the Rupture of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeds from the Infidels and not the Christian Prince.</p>
                  <p>After this Explanation, we believe that there is no Body, how Illiterate soever, that will not easily distinguish between the Different Rights by us set down, and which are of Force and Validity, and those which are not so. To the clearing of which, we shall contribute also farther by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections annex'd; wherein after the <hi>Pro,</hi> the Reader will also find the <hi>Contra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin then with the Enquiry, which we ought to make into the Pretensions of the King of <hi>France</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Castille,</hi> we must say, that the first which are grounded upon the Will and Testament of Don <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Oviedo,</hi> in favour of <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> are of no Validity for three Reasons. The first is, that <hi>Charlemaign</hi> being Emperour, if <hi>Castille</hi> were to be incorporated into one of his Dominions, it would in all probability follow, that it must have been into the most noble, which was that of the Empire, and not the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which was Inferiour to it, and which ought not to be look'd upon otherwise then as a Member of the Empire. Which is justify'd by the Partition which <hi>Lewis the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair</hi> made among his Children; in regard that always <hi>Charles</hi> did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his Brother for the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Kingdom of <hi>Castille,</hi> neither holds of <hi>France</hi> nor the Empire, by reason of this last Will and Testament; because there was no reason for it during the stay of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> in the Kingdom, and for that after the Death of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> his Nephews succeeded, and yet 'tis no where to be found that ever they pay'd Homage to any Body. Moreover granting that this Right were good in its self, 'tis now lost by a Prescription of above 800 Years.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that the Claim by vertue of the Marriage of <hi>Blanche</hi> with <hi>Lewis</hi> IX. is of a later Date, however no benefit can now be made of it, because it is above four Centuries ago since that Marriage happen'd. But besides a Possession of so long standing, and so well secur'd by a Great Number of Treaties made between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was not a Tittle mention'd concerning these Claims, there are two Authentick Ones to be produc'd, by which they are absolutely renounc'd. The first is of the same <hi>Lewis</hi> IX. who marrying his Daughter <hi>Blanch</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand de la Cerda,</hi> Grandchild to <hi>Ferdinand the Invader,</hi> in the Year 1267. covenanted by the Contract, that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> should renounce to his Daughter <hi>Blanch</hi> and her Successours all the Right and Claim which he could pretend to have to <hi>Castille.</hi> And the second bears date in the Year 1290. between <hi>Sanches</hi> King of <hi>Castille,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> by which he ratifies and approves the Renunciation which <hi>Lewis</hi> had made; and at the same time renounces all the Rights that he himself could pretend to.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Charlemaign</hi> was call'd into <hi>Spain</hi> by Don <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Castille,</hi> as we have already said, he expell'd the <hi>Moors</hi> not only out of the Dominions of that Prince, but also out of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which at that Time was a very small Country holding of the City of <hi>Saragossa,</hi> which he gave with the Dependencies belonging to it, to <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera,</hi> to hold it of him under the Title of an Earldom, performing Homage and Fealty; which he did all the Time that he liv'd. And upon this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture it is that the King of <hi>France</hi> grounds his first Right. But we never read that after his Death, either <hi>Joseph</hi> his Son, or <hi>Alarias</hi> his Son-in-Law, acknowledg'd any Superiour Power to the time of D. <hi>Fortuno Ximenes</hi> the last Count of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who marry'd his only Daughter <hi>Ʋra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> to Don <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> about the Year 950. By which Marriage the County of <hi>Arragon</hi> was annex'd to the Crown till the Year 1034. that the King Don <hi>Sancho,</hi> to Recompence the Valour of his Second Son D. <hi>Ramira,</hi> who had in a publick Duel couragiously defended the Honour of his Mother, who was accus'd of Adultery, gave him <hi>Arragon,</hi> which he caus'd to be erected into a Kingdom by the Pope; for which he did Homage, in acknowledgment of that Erection. And since that time the Popes have always pretended to the Sovereignty of <hi>Arragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Claim of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> is grounded upon the Confiscation made by <hi>Clement</hi> V. in favour of <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> of all the Knights Templer's Estates, after that Order was suppress'd by a Decree of the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> in the Year 1310. And in regard that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time Don <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> had bequeath'd his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to those Knights by his Last Will and Testament, made at <hi>Bayonne</hi> in the Year 1132. there has been a pretence that <hi>Arragon</hi> ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended among those Estates with which they had been gratify'd by the Pope, and which by Consequence belong'd to him. To which they added the Investiture whlch Pope <hi>Martin</hi> IV. gave to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1282. to the Exclusion of <hi>Peter,</hi> lawful King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who was by him Excommunicated for being the Author of the <hi>Sicilian Vespers.</hi> And by vertue of this Excommunication, and after he had beaten Don <hi>Peter,</hi> made himself Master of the Best Part of his Kingdom. Nevertheless in a in a little time after, it return'd to the Family of the same <hi>Peter,</hi> who had been driven out of it, and they enjoy'd it above Two Hunder'd Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Interruption. Till <hi>Lewis</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> came with a numerous Army to seize upon the Kingdom, which he claim'd in Right of his Wife <hi>Yoland:</hi> and the Truth is, his Claim was very legal. But for the Reader's better understanding of this Matter we must set forth, that <hi>John,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Peter,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Ceremonious,</hi> reign'd Nine Years, in which time he was twice marry'd; first with <hi>Mathea,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> and by that Wedlock he had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nam'd <hi>Joane,</hi> who dy'd young. His second Wife was <hi>Yoland de Barr,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46341:15"/> by whom he had <hi>Yoland,</hi> marry'd afterwards to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> before mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Now after the Death of King <hi>John,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Joan, Lewis</hi> claim'd the Succession as next Heir, as we have said already; but <hi>Sibilla,</hi> Mother-in-Law to King <hi>John,</hi> who had a high Reputation in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and who had a Kindness for <hi>Yoland,</hi> caus'd Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Castille,</hi> Duke of <hi>Penafief,</hi> to be chosen King, tho' he were no more then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased King's Nephew. However, he was preferr'd before <hi>Lewis</hi> by the Grandees of the Kingdom, who seated him upon the Throne; which he so well defended by the Force of his Arms, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was constrain'd to return a Loser. From this same <hi>Lewis</hi> it is, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> derive their Fourth and Last Pretence upon <hi>Arragon,</hi> because that his Son <hi>Reginald</hi> having made <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> who was Nephew to him, his Heir; he also, by his last Will and Testament, dated <hi>December</hi> 11. 1481. left the Inheritance to <hi>Lewis</hi> XI.</p>

                  <head>Enquiries into the Pretensions of the King of <hi>France</hi> upon <hi>Arragon.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already said, when we discours'd of the Claim which the King of <hi>France</hi> lays to <hi>Castille,</hi> that there was no ground for reviving an old Investiture, which never had any Effect, and which besides that it was prescrib'd by a Period of above 800 Years, upon due Examination, could never be found to have been granted by the Donor as King of <hi>France,</hi> but as Emperour, and so can never be of any Validity. Now in regard the Dispute is here concerning the same Matter of Fact, the same Emperour, and the same Time, we shall say no more of it, but refer the Reader to what has been already said.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore proceed to the more recent Claims. That which is grounded upon the Confiscation of the Knights-Templers Estates, granted to <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> V. carries something a little more weight with it, but not sufficient to render it Effectual, besides that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nullities in it. For First, the Pope had no Right to give away that Kingdom, besides that in regard it was not specify'd in the Bull, it cannot be said to be Comprehended therein. But the two stronger Reasons which utterly annihilate this Claim, are that <hi>Alphonso</hi> could not make the Knights-Templers his Heirs to the Exclusion of his Brothers: and in the Second Place, the Knights-Templars themselves renounc'd all their Right to the Kingdom by the Treaty which <hi>Raymond,</hi> Grand Master of the Order, made with Don <hi>Raymond Berrenger,</hi> Son-in-Law to Don <hi>Ramira,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> so that after they were suppress'd, they had no longer any farther Title.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the <hi>French</hi> will reply, that something may be said in answer to this: but what Reply will we make to the claim which our King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from the Investiture granted by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> IV. to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip?</hi> We shall answer, that the Popes have no Right over the Temporals of Princes; that whatever they have hitherto assum'd has been by pure Usurpation; which they might so much the more easily
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46341:15"/> pretend to, because they were sure to have those Princes of their side, who were to be Gainers by the Investiture in the Estates of Others. And thus the Avarice and Ambition of some Princes, the weakness, forbearance, and permission of others, were the only Foundations upon which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> erected her Unjust and Tyrannical Monarchy. However, great and Couragious Princes never acknowledg'd this Usurp'd Power; and we have no small reason to be surpriz'd, that the King of <hi>France</hi> should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Donation so Chimerical, after those Propositions which he caus'd his Clergy to sign about twelve Years ago.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, that this is quite another Case. For <hi>Arragon</hi> is a Fief of the Church, and according to the Law, when the Vassal is become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Felony, the Fief returns to the Sovereign by right of Reversion, and he may dispose of it to whom he thinks fitting. To which we shall answer once for all, that the Pope being a Bishop, neither ought nor can in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner enter upon a Sovereignty; and as he never had a Right to enter upon the Temporalities of Princes, they are sufficiently warranted to shake off that Yoke whenever it lies in their Power. But to cut off all Objections and Replies, we need no more then cite the Treaty of <hi>Clermont</hi> in the Year 1260. between <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and Don <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> by which all the Claims that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> could lay to that of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> were absolutely resign'd and releas'd, with a Discharge for the Future from all Relievance and Homage.</p>
                  <p>There remains then, only the Right of <hi>Lewis</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who as Husband to <hi>Yoland</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ought to succeed <hi>John</hi> his Father-in-Law: but this Claim is deriv'd a little too far off to be of any value; the Kings of <hi>France</hi> not having been ever in Possession, but only claiming by vertue of a Will made by one that had meerly a bare Title, grounded upon the Will of a Prince, who far from having reign'd and possess'd <hi>Arragon,</hi> pretended only to a Title in right of another; so that these Claims are deriv'd to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> only from Titular to Titular, and from Will to Will. But besides that the Centuries during which the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> have been in Possession, give 'em a Sufficient Title, which excludes <hi>France</hi> for ever, and all that pretend any Title from her, there is one more Reason that will admit of no Reply; which is, that <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King, or Usurper of <hi>Arragon,</hi> referr'd themselves to a Voluntary Arbitration, and promis'd to stand to the Decision of Nine Lords of the Kingdom, which they chose unanimously, <hi>viz.</hi> three of <hi>Arragon,</hi> three of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> and three of <hi>Valencia;</hi> who after a serious and mature Debate, gave the Crown to Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by their Sentence pronounc'd in the Year 1415. which was confirm'd by Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. to whose Determination they referr'd themselves the Second Time. So that the Question was absolutely decided.</p>

                  <p>FEw People agree upon the Time that <hi>Catalogna</hi> began to hold of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Some say, it was <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> who erected it into an Earldom, and invested in it <hi>Jeffery the Hairy,</hi> about the Year 885. Others assert that it was <hi>Charlemaign</hi> who gave it to <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Arrio,</hi> which to me seems most probable; it being certain that <hi>Charlemaign</hi> conquer'd <hi>Catalogna</hi> in his march into <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Eghinar</hi> reports. <hi>Sibi subegit totum Montis Pyrenaei jugum, &amp; usque ad Iberum Amnem, qui Hispaniae Agros se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, ad Tartosae urbis Moenia Balearico Mari miscetur.</hi> However it were, 'tis sufficiently known, that till the Year 1131. <hi>Catalogna</hi> had always pay'd Fealty and Homage to <hi>France,</hi> and that all the Publick Acts were made in the Name, and dated from the Reign of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> But D. <hi>Alphonso</hi> who reign'd about that time in <hi>Arragon,</hi> stomaching the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Homage to any Body, declar'd himself Independent, forbid the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to make use of any other Date then that of the Year of our Lord, and from that time till the Year 1636. at what time the <hi>Catalognians</hi> revolted from <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. the French had never any Homage pay'd 'em from thence. But they pretend to have acquir'd a new Right by that Revolt, because the <hi>Catalognians</hi> observing the Usual Maxim of Rebels, which is to support themselves under the Protection of their Sovereign's greatest Enemy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd themselves up to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who receiv'd 'em. And they grounded the Occasion of their Revolt upon this, that by the Law of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> in 1320. of the three Provinces of <hi>Arragon, Catalogna,</hi> and <hi>Valencia,</hi> he granted <hi>Catalogna</hi> certain Immunities and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which being broken, the <hi>Catalognians</hi> shook off the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and made choice of another Sovereign. Whence the King of <hi>France</hi> concludes that their Delivering themselves up to him, was Legal.</p>

                  <p>'TIs to no purpose to alledge the Ancient Rights; for besides that the French have a long time surceas'd to revive those Titles, and for that at the same Time that <hi>Alphonso</hi> shook off the Yoke, <hi>Philip the August,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> VIII. seem'd to approve the Act by their Silence, by the same Treaty of <hi>Clermont</hi> also <hi>Philip</hi> resign'd to <hi>James</hi> all his Pretensions to <hi>Catalogna,</hi> as well as those upon <hi>Arragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is more unreasonable: for 'tis an idle thing to say that the Law of Union could justifie the <hi>Catalognians</hi> from revolting against their Sovereign; and the making use of such Pretences is an open and bare-fac'd Attempt to usurp what belongs to another. However, to speak properly, 'twas only by vertue of this Seditious Donation, that the King of <hi>France</hi> sent his Viceroys thither, who continu'd the Title also after the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46341:16"/> had reconquer'd it, and that he sometimes still assumes the Title of Count of <hi>Catalogna:</hi> for as to his old Claim, 'tis too much superannuated for him to think any more of it. But neither is the one any Better then the other, seeing that the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty has most positively and clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the Point by the 43d.

                  <p>IF <hi>Catalogna</hi> were duly resign'd to the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made it appear, 'tis past dispute that the Dependencies upon it were resign'd in like manner; so that there is no necessity of entring into any new discussion of that Point.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns the Title of Mortgage, upon which the King of <hi>France</hi> erects his Claim by reason of the Loan of 300000 Crowns, it has been a long time quite out of doors, in regard that <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. releas'd it absolutely to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> to whom he resign'd the County <hi>gratis,</hi> to the end he should not molest him, during his Neopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Expedition, wherein he was more Fortunate then Prudent; seeing that he prov'd Successful, tho' he had neither Captain, nor Money, nor good Ministers; which evidently appear'd by this Idle Restitution; for which if <hi>Charles</hi> could not have obtain'd the whole 300000 Crowns, however he might have had a good part. <hi>Comines</hi> says, That there were two Franciscan Fryers, the own his Confessour, the other the Dutchess of <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s, that perswaded him to it, assuring him that the King his Father had so order'd it upon his Death-Bed, and that <hi>Charles,</hi> who was a Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly good Natur'd, fell into their Snare. But in regard there is no likelihood that <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. upon his Death-Bed should entrust any other then his Son with his Last Will and Testament, there is as little Reason that he should suffer himself to be over-rul'd by a couple of Priests. We are therefore of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Opinion, who says, That it was the Bishop of

                     <hi>Albi, Charles</hi>'s Tutor, who being brib'd by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> prevail'd with him to doe it, perswading him that it was the only way to hinder the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> from invading <hi>France,</hi> while he was busi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in regard it was very Prejudicial to the Crown, the King of <hi>France</hi> thought that a Pretence sufficient to repair his Losses; and therefore it is, that he sets up this Claim among the best that he has, to the Dominions of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We shall not trouble our selves to raise superfluous Arguments upon this Point.

                  <head>The King of <hi>France</hi>'s Claims to the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe King of <hi>France,</hi> by vertue of his Titles to the two <hi>Sicilies,</hi> enjoys <hi>Provence</hi> at this day, which is a Dependence upon 'em. It is grounded upon three Heads; the first of which is, the Investiture which Pope <hi>Ʋrban</hi> IV. gave to <hi>Charles</hi> the Brother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in 1262. to the Exclusion of <hi>Conrad,</hi> and <hi>Conradin</hi> the Children of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who rebell'd against the Holy See, and for that reason the Pope depriv'd him of his Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and gave 'em to <hi>Charles,</hi> who enjoy'd 'em till the Year 1281. at what time <hi>Peter,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who marry'd <hi>Constance</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Manfred,</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of <hi>Frederick,</hi> desirous to revenge the Death of <hi>Conradin,</hi> whose Head <hi>Lewis</hi> had inhumanly caus'd to be struck off, won to his Party a certain Person whose Name was <hi>John de Procida,</hi> who had been one of <hi>Conradin</hi>'s Officers, and sent him to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to treat with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Alexis,</hi> about assisting him to drive the French out <hi>Sicily.</hi> After which <hi>Procida</hi> returning to <hi>Messina,</hi> counterfeited himself a Mad man, and when he met with the French, put the end of a long Trunk to their Ears, and told 'em any Idle Stories that came into his Head, and then play'd with a Quarter-Staff: but when he met with the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> he instructed 'em by means of the said Trunk, which way to shake off the Yoke of French Tyranny, and bid 'em Massacre all the French. And he manag'd his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Design so cunningly, that it was put in Execution upon <hi>Easter</hi>-Day, in the Year 1282. about the Hour of <hi>Vespers.</hi> The next Year, <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> was Crown'd there; since which time <hi>Sicily</hi> has been always a Dependance upon that Kingdom. However, <hi>Charles</hi> D. of <hi>Anjou</hi> and his Successour, reign'd at <hi>Naples</hi> for the space of 170 Years, which was to the Year 1435. at what time <hi>Joan</hi> the II. the last of that Race, dy'd. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46341:17"/> from the Heirs of this House of <hi>Anjou</hi> it is, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their first Title to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Other comes from another Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> who after that she had for several Years lead a worse then Licentious Life, with <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Otranto, Otho</hi> of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and several Others, put to Death her Husband because he could not endure her Debaucheries. After which, she marry'd <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> whom she likewise put to Death, and by these Infamous Crimes having incurr'd the Indignation of <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VI. she put her self under the Protection of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and by his permission she adopted and made her Heir <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in <hi>France,</hi> during the Minority of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. his Nephew. But the <hi>Hungarians</hi> coming to <hi>Naples</hi> under the leading of <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd the Queen in the Castle of <hi>Ovo,</hi> took her and caus'd her to be Hang'd, to revenge the Death of <hi>Andrew</hi> his Kinsman and Brother of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> After that, <hi>Charles de Duras</hi> made himself Master of the Kingdom, and kept it, both He and his Posterity, maugre all the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this same Second House of <hi>Anjou,</hi> till the Year 1414. that <hi>Ladis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> dying, another <hi>Joan</hi> succeeded him, from whom the Kings of <hi>France</hi> derive their Third Title, because this <hi>Joan,</hi> who was a lewd Woman, and also a little craz'd, had adopted for her Son, <hi>Lewis</hi> III. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to the Exclusion of <hi>Alphonso.</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> whom she had adopted before, but whose Adoption she had vacated, because he besieg'd, took her, and afterwards shut her up in the Castle of <hi>Naples.</hi> These are the Claims of <hi>France</hi> to this Kingdom.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ACcording to that Proposition which we have asserted, and which we are apt to believe that all the World, except the <hi>Italians,</hi> will agree with us, to be Infallible, That the Popes have no Power over the Temporalities of Princes, the Investiture of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> granted to <hi>Charles,</hi> Brother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> by <hi>Ʋrban</hi> IV. is absolutely void. <hi>Frederick</hi> was an Emperor, who held not of the Church in any respect; so that the Pope had no Power to dispose of his Dominions. This is an Axiom from whence all Kings and Princes are never to depart, if of Sovereigns as they are they have no mind to be reduc'd to the Degree not only of Subjects, but of Slaves; there being no Dominion in the World so Tyrannical as that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let then this be said and granted once for all, to the end it may serve for a Rule for the future.</p>
                  <p>The Second Title which the King of <hi>France</hi> pretends to <hi>Naples,</hi> is not much Better then the First; for an Adulterous Woman and a Parricide, such as Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> could never make a Donation valid in Law. Besides <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was the Person to whom the Donation was made, never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd any thing in <hi>Naples,</hi> which is a great Defect in a Title, especially grown out of Date. But suppose he had been a Reigning King in that Kingdom, shall the Kings of <hi>France</hi> engross to themselves a Title to inherit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46341:18"/> all the Kingdoms that were upon a time possess'd by Princes of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Add to this, that if the Pope's consent were of any necessity in such a Donation, because <hi>Charles</hi> the Brother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had made <hi>Naples</hi> a Fief of the Church, we may averr, that <hi>Joan</hi> had no such consent; for that of the two Popes, who then pretended to the Papal Chair at one and the same time, he who sate at <hi>Rome,</hi> was so far from approving her Conduct and her Actions, that he sent for <hi>Charles de Duras</hi> out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her Crimes, and Revenge the Death of his Uncle.</p>
                  <p>The Other <hi>Joan,</hi> who adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> the III. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> was a Woman whose Conduct was no more to be commended then the others. She had for her Favourite one <hi>Caraccioli,</hi> that came from the Dregs of the People, whom she had advanc'd to the Highest Employments in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by whom she suffer'd her self to be wholly govern'd, and with whom she led a Scandalous Life in the Face of the Sun, that 'twas no wonder, if <hi>Alphonso,</hi> tyr'd out with her wicked way of Living, and knowing that she was not a Woman to be reform'd, caus'd her to be shut up in Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment. It may be question'd also, whether she had the Right Use of her Reason; for in that case <hi>Alphonso</hi> could not be blam'd for doing as he did. Now the greatest Part of the Best Historians give us that Account of her. But tho' it were not so, the King of <hi>France</hi> has no reason to pretend to any Advantage from this Title, which as well in respect of this as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> descends to him only from a Titular Inheritance never possess'd, and that an Indirect one too, as being grounded only upon the two Wills and Testaments already mention'd.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore should we trouble our selves to refute these over Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Titles, were they the best in the world in themselves. For have they not been annihilated by divers Resignations which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have made in several Treaties? One of which was that concluded at <hi>Noyon,</hi> in the Year 1516. by which <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of <hi>France</hi> resign'd and releas'd all his Pretensions to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. 'Tis true, that there were other Things which were not perform'd, and it may be said, that by Consequence the Treaty remains Imperfect. But the Case is not the same in respect of the Treaties of <hi>Madrid, Cambray, Crepy,</hi> and <hi>Vervins,</hi> which have confirm'd that of <hi>Noyon,</hi> upon that very Article; and particularly that Important Treaty of 1524. by which <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. renounc'd without any Exception for himself and his Heirs, all his Claims and Pretensions to <hi>Naples,</hi> in favour of the Marriage of his Niece <hi>Germana de Foix</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Crown of <hi>Navarr</hi> is one of the most Ancient in <hi>Europe:</hi> It derives its Original, according to <hi>Petrini,</hi> from <hi>Hercules,</hi> who after his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory gain'd over the <hi>Lominians,</hi> lay'd the Foundations of this Kingdom; for which reason the Kings of <hi>Navarr</hi> boasted themselves to be descended from the Family of <hi>Hercules.</hi> However it were, this is certain, that 'tis above 900 Years, since Don <hi>Garcia Ximenes,</hi> whom we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46341:18"/> by the way, reign'd in <hi>Navarr;</hi> and that he was also honour'd by Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Most Faithful King,</hi> to be borne by him and his Successours; in acknowledgment for that in Conjunction with <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> he had expell'd the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> as appears by his Bull dated in the Year 744. which begins, <hi>Fidelissimo Regi nostro, Garciae Ximenio, Regi Subarbiae, Dilecto,</hi> &amp;c. Just as the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> for their Services done the Holy See, have obtain'd the Title of <hi>Most Christian,</hi> which was given 'em in the Council of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Crown of <hi>Navarr</hi> has likewise had this particular Advantage above all Others, that it never fell under Collateral Inheritance, every King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always left Issue behind him, either Male or Female, till this present time that their Race is continu'd in Monsieur the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who has three Children living. For though he be not in possession of the Kingdom, that do's not hinder him from being descended in a direct Line, nor from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Interest in the Kingdom, grounded upon the next and lawful Inheritance. Which we shall make out, by saying, that <hi>Charles</hi> III. King of <hi>Navarr</hi> had but one Daughter, nam'd <hi>Blanch,</hi> who was marry'd to <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> From which Marriage descended <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Viana,</hi> who was poyson'd by <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Castille,</hi> his Mother-in-Law, and <hi>Leonora</hi> his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster who succeeded to the Crown, and was the Wife of <hi>Gaston de Foix.</hi> They had for their Daughter and Heiress <hi>Catherine,</hi> who was marry'd to <hi>John d' Albret. Henry d' Albret,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> was their Son, who marry'd <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Sister to <hi>Francis</hi> I. and from that Wedlock descended <hi>Joan,</hi> the Only Daughter and Heiress of the Crown. She was Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> Princess of <hi>Boarn,</hi> Countess of <hi>Foix, Armagnac</hi> and <hi>Bigorre,</hi> and was marry'd to <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendome,</hi> first Prince of the Blood, from whom descended <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. the Father of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. and Grandfather of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. now Reigning. By this Genealogy, is to be seen the Establishment of his Right to an Estate, which as yet he do's not enjoy. But instead thereof, he enjoys many others more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, which would not belong to him, if every Body had their own. So that when Restitution comes to be made, he must restore many fair Territories and Provinces, which he detains from the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>

                  <p>AMong all the Pretensions of the King of <hi>France,</hi> we find none better fix'd then this, for tho' there be a Possession of above 150 Years that makes against him, nevertheless, because that neither he nor his Predecessors ever positively renounc'd it, therefore it appears to be so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46341:19"/> that in good Conscience it did not belong to him. And indeed the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> possess it by no other Title then by a Grant of the Pope, who Excommunicated <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and put his Kingdom under Interdiction, for the slightest and most Illegal Cause in the world. It was <hi>Julius</hi> the II. who at that time govern'd the Holy See: and because he hated <hi>Alphonso d' Este,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but had a great Love for his Territories, he Excommunicated him, that he might make himself Master of 'em. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. King of <hi>France,</hi> who was his Father-in-Law, gave him Assistance both of Men and Money, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Pope to declare him Excommunicated <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and to sollicite the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make War upon him. But in regard they were to pass through <hi>Navarr,</hi> King <hi>John</hi> oppos'd 'em. Upon which, the Pope let flye his Thunders at him also, as adhering to the <hi>French,</hi> who were Friends to the <hi>Ferraresi.</hi> However, by vertue of this Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> seiz'd upon his Country, as if they had had a firm Title to it, and shar'd it between 'em; and because it lay more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> then the <hi>English,</hi> they agreed together for the Summ of 500000 Crowns, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> either gave or promis'd to give the <hi>English;</hi> in consideration of which Money, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was to have the whole, except <hi>Bern, Bigorre,</hi> and some part of <hi>Navarr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By what has been said, it appears that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has no good Foundation for his Possession of this Country. Otherwise, we must grant the Popes those Rights which they with so much greediness covet, and allow 'em a Power to Expel Princes out of their Dominions, whenever they shall take a Fancy to shew their Authority, which would be the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute overturning of all Apostolick and Episcopal Institution.</p>
                  <p>For the Spiritual Power of Bishops no way extends it self over the Temporalities either of Princes or Private Persons. This is the Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers, which is to be observ'd in their Writings, and which they preach'd as they had receiv'd it from the Apostles. Thus <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> declares, That as a Bishop he had not power to condemn <hi>Athanasius</hi> to any Corporal Punishment, because it was a Privilege that belong'd solely to the Magistrates, and that all that he could doe by vertue of that Power which he had receiv'd from Christ, was only to excommunicate him: and every where he loudly exclaims against Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who intrude themselves into Temporal Affairs and Jurisdictions, as altogether contrary to their Commission. In a word, that we may not enter any farther into this Controversie, 'tis sufficient for the Justification of our Assertion as to the Pope and his assum'd Jurisdiction in Temporals, that our Principle is founded upon the Old and New Testaments, upon the Fathers, upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe City of <hi>Montpellier</hi> was formerly an Earldom annex'd to the Crown of <hi>Arragon,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Mary,</hi> Countess of <hi>Montpellier</hi> with Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> which gave that Prince a means to be particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Principal Persons of the Country, who were almost all of 'em <hi>Albigeois;</hi> and he listen'd so attentively to 'em, that at length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Doctrine which they taught, he embrac'd it altogether, and declar'd himself their Protectour against the <hi>Croisade</hi> with the Pope had publickly excited, with a Design to exterminate 'em, and of which the Count of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was the Head. But in regard that at that time, his Son, Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> was a Student at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and because that City was already fallen under the Power of the <hi>Croisade,</hi> they detain'd him Prisoner, and kept him very close till the Year 1213. at what time D. <hi>Pedro</hi> was slain at the Siege of <hi>Moret;</hi> after which, they restor'd the Son to his Liberty, and sent him into <hi>Arragon</hi> to take Possession of his Kingdom. Nevertheless, because that during his Imprisonment, he had had none but Monks for his Governours, they infus'd such a world of Superstition into his Mind, that he could never get rid of it afterwards; and more then that, during his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he made a Vow, That if it should please God and the Holy Virgin to restore him to his Kingdom, he would institute an Order for the Redemption of Captives, he would go on Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome;</hi> and do a world of other such things, which he afterwards perform'd; and more then that, he engag'd himself out of a pure Motive of Devotion, to conquer the Island of <hi>Majorca,</hi> which was possess'd by a <hi>Moresco</hi> King, whose Name was <hi>Abohide,</hi> and who by his Pyracies greatly infested the <hi>Christians.</hi> And indeed he prov'd very Successful in his Enterprize, for that after a Siege of fifteen Months, which he lay'd to the Capital City where the King of the <hi>Moors</hi> was kill'd, with the greatest part of his Men, who made a wonderful Resistance, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd the Island. Any other but Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> would have enjoy'd his Conquest, and the Advantage which it brought to his Crown. But he, infatuated with his misguided Devotion, did Homage for his New Conquest to the Church of <hi>Magellone</hi> in <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and willingly made himself the Founder of it without any Necessity.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who have always had an Eye upon what might turn to their Advantage, and would not let this Opportunity slip, without acting according to their own Interests, never gave over till they had found a way to get the City of <hi>Montpellier</hi> into their Hands, which they purchas'd at length in the Year 1347. of Don <hi>Jago,</hi> King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> together with <hi>Majorca,</hi> for the summ of 120000 Crowns. After which, they agreed with the Bishops of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> giving the Fief of <hi>Poussan</hi> and <hi>Frescalin</hi> in Exchange for the Sovereignty of <hi>Majorca,</hi> which they pretend to have been by that means and at little charges incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or rather re-united to their Crown. For they say, that the Ground

                  <p>IT must be acknowledg'd that Bigottry in the Soul of a Prince, is a Weakness pernicious to his Territories, and prejudicial to his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 'Tis good for a Prince to be pious and devout; nay, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that he should be so. For without it, we hold it morally impossible that he should govern justly, prudently and gloriously. But in matter of Devotion, as in all other things, there is a certain Medium, a just Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity, from which there is no deviating, without falling at the same time into some Extremity of Impiety or Superstition. A Bigot was never Politick: and indeed how should he be so? seeing that Policy is only to be acquir'd by Experience, Study, and Natural Parts; whereas Bigotry on the other side is the Daughter of Ignorance. Thus we always find that Bigots are always very ignorant; which immediately appears from hence, that they make the Fundamental and Essential Part of Religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Vinegar Faces, demure Countenances and minute Trifles, which for the most part are the most Unprofitable Things in the World. And these sort of People usually fall into all the Snares that are lay'd for 'em, and they that can but find a way to pretend either God or the Saints to be of their Party, shall make 'em do whatever they please without the least Examination. For proof of this we might cite Examples enough: but we shall not put our selves to the needless trouble of producing any more then this one that makes to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> was one of these Persons devout in Trifles. He thought he should doe a Meritorious Act in offering to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom the Church of <hi>Magellonne</hi> is dedicated, the Sovereignty of <hi>Majorca;</hi> and never considering the Consequences that might attend it, which he foresaw so much the less, because it was in his Earldom of <hi>Montpellier</hi> wherein the Church was built, that he effected his Design. And 'tis most certain that in paying Homage after this manner to the Virgin of that Church, that he never had it in his thoughts, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> would one day take their Advantage from it to make his Successours Feudataries and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magers to their Crown: yet he ought to have foreseen the Inconvenience, and not to have put himself to the Trouble of giving Temporal Signiories to the Virgin, who gave him no Thanks for Offerings that so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd her. But in regard the Thing is done, let us examine whether <hi>France</hi> can assume a Lawful Right to the Kingdom of <hi>Majorca,</hi> by vertue of the Purchase which they made of the Earldom of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and their Agreements with the Bishops.</p>
                  <p>We say he cannot: and we shall prove it by many Reasons, beyond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; the first of which particularly admits of no Reply; which is,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46341:20"/> That Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> did not do Homage for his Crown to the Bishop, but to the Virgin, and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> having never contracted with Her, all their Agreements became void, unless the Bishops of <hi>Montpellier</hi> have a Sufficient Deputation to shew from her; which we are apt to believe they have not. Moreover, considering things in themselves, there is so great a difference between a Homage pay'd to the Holy Virgin, who since her Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, never troubl'd her self with the Affairs of this World, at least like a Person that had Lands and Tenements here, and that other Homage which Men are oblig'd to pay to such a King as the King of <hi>France,</hi> whose Dominion was never very gentle toward Feudataries, that Common Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will never admit that such a Fief should be alienated from the One to the Other. And if we have no written Law to quote upon this Point, because the Case being altogether Extraordinary the Legislators never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themselves of framing any Constitutions in this particular, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless we have the Divine Law which is offended by this Pretension. The sole Question is then to know, whether Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> pay'd Homage to the Virgin or the Bishop; for the Dispute is not well as yet decided. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are apt to believe, that we may boldly assert, that it was to the Saint, and not to the Bishop, who was his Subject by right of Birth and Patronage of the Church, which always belong'd to the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> in the Territories and Countries under their Obedience: so that he must have been the Subject of his Subject; which is absurd. Nor do's it behove the <hi>French</hi> to ridicule this manner of paying Homage to the Virgin: for tho' indeed there be a great deal of Simplicity in the Ceremony, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>French</hi> Kings were they that introduc'd it. <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debondir,</hi> being the First that ever thought of it, gave the City of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> with all its Dependencies to the Virgin; and <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. desirous to imitate him, far surpass'd him, for he pay'd Fealty and Homage for the City of <hi>Bologne</hi> to the Holy Virgin before her Image, his Head bare, without Girdle or Spurs; and gave her as an Acknowledgement of the Tenure by which he held of her, a Heart of Massy Gold, engaging himself and his Successors to be her Vassals for the said City of <hi>Bologne;</hi> nevertheless, we never read that the Bishops ever pretended by vertue of that voluntary Homage, to assume any Sovereignty over the King of <hi>France.</hi> There were others also that follow'd the Example of these two Princes: and thus <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of <hi>Russia,</hi> offer'd his Kingdom to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> surrender'd his Kingdom to the Holy Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, let us suppose a Thing that never was; that it was not to the Virgin that Don <hi>Jaimo</hi> pay'd Homage for his Kingdom, but that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd this Noble Right to the Church, and the Governours of it, it would not follow thence, that it belong'd to the Bishop, but rather to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateship of the Church, which is seated within half a League of the City, upon the Gulph of <hi>Leon,</hi> at present no more then a bare Parish. If they object to us the Superiority of the Bishop over the Curate, who seiz'd it by a Sovereign Right preferrable to that of his Inferior, We answer, That this Right ought to return to the Pope, who is as much Superior to the Bishop, as the Bishop to the Curate, and so it came to pass that the Kings of <hi>Majorca</hi> should hold of no Body but the Pope, upon whom they already
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46341:21"/> depended for their Kingdom of <hi>Arragon.</hi> But these Dependencies upon the Pope are only fit to be laught at, he having no Authority over the Temporalities of Princes, as we have asserted and prov'd. To all these Reasons then we shall add two more: the First is Possession, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Rights of the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Second is, that tho' it were true, that the Bishop had been made real Sovereign of <hi>Majorca,</hi> he could not have had any Right to have alienated that Sovereignty for two Reasons; the one, for that according to the Law, the Estates of the Church cannot be alienated; and the second, because that Devotion being the Motive to Don <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s Donation, it tacitly imply'd the Condition, that the Bishop could not resign his Right to any Prince whatever, much less to the King of <hi>France</hi> then to any other, considering the Difference between One Lordship and the Other.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SArdigna</hi> is an Island in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, erected into a Kingdom by Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who invested in it Don <hi>Jago,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition that he should conquer the <hi>Moors:</hi> after which Don <hi>Pedro</hi> having incurr'd the Indignation of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the IV. by reason of the <hi>Sicilian Vespers,</hi> he declar'd the Kingdom of <hi>Sardigna</hi> forfeited by him, as well as that of <hi>Arragon</hi> and his Other Territories, and invested in 'em <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> in the Year 1282. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, <hi>Sardigna</hi> never fell under their power, for that the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> tho' pretended Heirs of <hi>Charles,</hi> made so little reckoning of that Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, that <hi>Philip</hi> to acquire a Better Title, purchas'd the Island of <hi>Jago</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> together with the County of <hi>Montpellier</hi> in 1347.

                  <p>THo' the Popes Investitures are as bad Titles as any that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and that the <hi>French</hi> know very well how to baffle 'em, when they are not made in their Favour, nevertheless they make no Scruple to urge such Titles every day; which only proceeds from a Partiality never to be Excus'd. For in this case Princes must agree among themselves, whether the Right of Investiture by the Popes be valid or no, to the end the Question may be absolutely determin'd. In the mean time, till this Dispute be decided one way or other, we shall always assert, that Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures granted by the Popes are void and of no Effect, by vertue of that Natural Axiom, which says, that <hi>No Man can give away that which is

                  <p>As to the Sale of <hi>Sardigna,</hi> made by <hi>Jago</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> it could give him no Title to it, because the Price agreed upon was not pay'd. The Title then which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> might seem to Urge upon better grounds, is the Mortgage of Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> XI.

                  <p>ACcording to the Pretensions of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> is a Dependance upon that Crown. The Title comes by the Marriage of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> V. with <hi>Valentina Galeazzi.</hi> She was the Daughter of <hi>John Galeazzi, who had Three Children, Giovanni Maria, Philip Maria,</hi> and her self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giovanni Maria</hi> succeeded his Father, and after he had rul'd Nine Years, dy'd without Issue, and left the Dukedom to his Brother, who left behind him no Children neither. So that after his Death, <hi>Valentina</hi> pretended to the Succession; as well for that she was the Next Heir, as by virtue of her Contract of Marriage; by which it was covenanted, That if <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Philip Maria</hi> deceased without Heirs Males, she should succeed to the Dutchy, both she and her Heirs. But her Husband, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> being kill'd at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s People, and <hi>Charles</hi> his Son a Prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> where he was detain'd for Five and twenty Years together, he could not exert his Claim.

                  </head>
                  <p>AS there is nothing more natural then the Succession of Children to their Parents Estates, a Man would think, at first, that <hi>Valentina</hi>'s Title were well grounded; and that she had a terrible Injustice done her, in giving the Dutchy to the Husband of a Bastard, to the Exclusion of her and her Heirs. But these fair Shews all vanish from him that will but give himself the trouble to enter into the Discussion of the Matter. <hi>Valentina,</hi> 'tis true, was the Legitimate Daughter of <hi>John Galeazzi,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and besides this Right of Blood, <hi>Galeazzi</hi> had made her his Heir, by his Contract of Marriage. But at the time that the Emperor <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> erected <hi>Milanois</hi> into a Dukedom, that he invested in it <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazzi</hi> himself, it was as it were a Male Fief; to which the Daughtets could not succeed, and which by consequence devolv'd again to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, after the Death of <hi>Philip Mariv,</hi> notwithstanding the Clauses in the Contract of <hi>Valentina</hi>'s Marriage, which could not be valid in that respect, as not being ratify'd by the Emperor. 'Tis true, that it was made during the Vacancy of the Empire; and that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. taking the Advantage of that Conjuncture, to affirme to himself an Authority that no way belong'd to him, had approv'd it. But 'tis visible, that that same Approbation was no other then a begg'd and useless Thing, the Pope having no Right to make any Decision in the Case. 'Twas the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> then to whom they ought to have afterwards address'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the giving his Consent, and ratifying the Clause which concern'd the Succession. Now, in regard he did not do it, but rather was so far from it, that he Disapprov'd the Thing, and granted the Investiture of the Dutchy to <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> 'tis as clear as day, that <hi>Valentina</hi>'s Title could be of no force. However, <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. being of another Opinion, march'd into <hi>Italy</hi> with a powerful Army, besieg'd <hi>Milan,</hi> and being Master of the Place, took <hi>Lodowick Storza,</hi> and carry'd him away Prisoner into <hi>France,</hi> where he dy'd in the Tower of <hi>Loches,</hi> and by that violent means <hi>Milanios</hi> fell into his Power; and the Children of <hi>Lodowick</hi> were constrain'd to fly into <hi>Germany,</hi> where they put themselv'es under the Protection of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> I. who receiv'd 'em honourably, but not so kindly as to undertake to restore 'em to their Dominions: quite the contrary, he granted to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Two Investures before-mention'd, upon which the King of <hi>France</hi> grounds his Second Title. But there are Two Reasons which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Reply, that utterly annull 'em. The First, is, Because the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror could not invest <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. the Invader of his Territories, to the Exclusion of the Lawful Princes who had never rebell'd against him, nor had ever given him any Occasion of Complaint. The Second, is, Because those two Investitures were not granted, but in Consideration of the Marriage which was concluded between <hi>Charles</hi> the Grand-child of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Claudia</hi> the Eldest Daughter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> as it is expresly set down in the Acts. And because the Match never came to any thing, 'tis most certain,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46341:22"/> that the Investiture could be of no Validity. And this would be a thing beyond all Controversie, if <hi>France</hi> would but do her self Justice; but she is not for that sort of Conduct. For which Reason, there is no question to be made, but that as frivolous as her Title is, she will be endeavouring to make the best of it, upon all Opportunities that shall offer; though she has already formally renounc'd it, not only by One, but by Four Treaties, which are those of <hi>Madrid, Cambray, Crespi,</hi> and <hi>Vervins.</hi>

This is all the Claim that the King of <hi>France</hi> can build upon: for it is above Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Years ago, since it fell to the House of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by the Resignation of <hi>Joanne de Grenich,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> made to Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> in 1443. who had assisted her against her Subjects that had expell'd her out of her Dominions; and because she had not Strength sufficient to maintain her Right, she chose rather to make an Agreement with the Duke, who allow'd her a Yearly Pension of Ten thousand Crowns, during her Life. Since which time he enjoy'd it, and the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> after him, till of late Years, that the King of <hi>France</hi> seiz'd upon it.</p>
                  <p>As for the Earldom of <hi>Chini</hi> in particular, we find in the Decree of the Chamber of <hi>Metz,</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> 20. 1682. the Pretences by virtue of which the King of <hi>France</hi> declares it to be annext to his Crown: and though there are several, we may reduce 'em to Three, which are the principal. The First is, Because the Earldom of <hi>Chini,</hi> with the Signiories, Appurtenances, and Dependencies belonging to it, were always under the Protection of <hi>France.</hi> The Second, is, Because the Earldom is a Fief holding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon <hi>Bar.</hi> And the Third, is, Because the People have all along resorted for their Law Affairs to <hi>Montmedy;</hi> which City belonging to the Crown, the Dependencies also belong to it.

                  </head>
                  <p>WE shall not trouble our selves thoroughly to examin the Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions contain'd in the Decree of the Chamber of <hi>Metz.</hi> 'Tis a Discussion which we leave to the Lawyers: only we must say, by the bye, That as to the First, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> expressly denies it; nor does he believe that the Sieur <hi>Ravaux,</hi> how diligent soever in his Enquiries, can ever make it out.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:46341:23"/>
                  <p>As to the Second, tis true, that one half of the Earldom of <hi>Chini</hi> held a long time of the Dutchy of <hi>Barr.</hi> But the Dutchy pay'd Homage also to <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> for the Castellanships of <hi>Marville</hi> and <hi>Arancy,</hi> for <hi>Conflans</hi> in <hi>Garnesi,</hi> and the Lordship of <hi>Marri.</hi> But because this reciprocal Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was inconvenient to the Lords, they have several times made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes and Compensations. Among others, by the Treaty concluded in 1342. between <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> Count of <hi>Barr,</hi> and several others. And this Affair was absolutely determin'd by the Treaty made afterwards between <hi>Charles</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in 1602. by which they release to each other all Claims and Pretensions, the one to the Earldom of <hi>Chini,</hi> the other to the Dutchy of <hi>Barr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Proposition is not worth the trouble of making any stay upon it. For in short, not to spend time in proving that the People of the County of <hi>Chini</hi> went for their Law to <hi>Beaumond,</hi> and other Places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they resorted to <hi>Montmedy,</hi> is it not a ridiculous thing to plead, That because a City which gave Law to a Country is dismember'd and alienated from it, therefore all the rest of the Country must follow that Alienation? By this Rule, the King of <hi>France</hi> need do no more then seize upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> which would be an Enterprize of no great difficulty, and so he might gain all the Spanish <hi>Low-Countries</hi> at one stroke.</p>
                  <p>But to cut all these Arguments short off, we need no more then referr to the Treaties made, first of all between <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. and <hi>Philip the Good,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in 1414. by which, <hi>he releases and resigns, for ever, to the said</hi> Philip, <hi>his Heirs, and all others claiming under him, all his Rights, Titles and Pretensions whatever to the Earldom of</hi> Chini, and <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi> And those other Treaties made by <hi>Francis</hi> I. and his Successors, at <hi>Madrid, Soisson, Cambray, Crespi;</hi> and <hi>Vervins.</hi>

                  <p>THe Original of this Pretension derives it self from the Marriage of <hi>Judith</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> her first Husband, passing thorough <hi>Flanders</hi> in her Return home to her own Country, was violently taken away by <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Great Forester of <hi>Flanders;</hi> who afterwards marry'd her, partly by Force, and partly by Consent.

                  <p>THese Claims were formerly very good, but they are now quite out of doors. <hi>Francis</hi> I. having resign'd and releas'd 'em all by that famous Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which we have cited already many times, as being the most Important that has been concluded in many Ages, and that by which <hi>France</hi> renounc'd all her Pretensions to the Dominions of his Most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesty. We know well, that the French hold that Treaty to be void, because King <hi>Francis</hi> was then a Prisoner when he concluded and sign'd it; grounding their Argument upon this Foundation in Law, <hi>Velle non creditur, qui detinetur:</hi> for which reason, so soon as he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> he protested against this Treaty in an Assembly of the States-General. But if this Maxim ought to be admitted, That Kings, when Prisoners, can make no Resignments of any Validity, 'tis in vain to Treat with 'em, (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> says very well:) It behoves the Victor to detain 'em in perpetual Imprisonment, to conquer their Dominions, absolutely to dispossess 'em; and of Sovereigns, that they were, to make 'em wretched Captives, in Imitation of the ancient Pagans. Or else, since there is no reaping any Advantage by taking Prisoners, we must make War without giving Quarter; and kill, without Mercy, all that fall into our Hands by the Chance of Arms: and then we shall see which is the best and most equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Maxim; either that which authorizing the Alienations which a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner makes to obtain his Liberty, restores, by that means, Peace and Union to his Dominions; or that which by abrogating and declaring 'em void, authorizes their utter Subversion, and constrains the Victor to render his Victory odious to all Humane kind, by the Massacre and Butchery of the Vanquish'd. But though upon those Principles the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> should be counted invalid, the same cannot be said of those of <hi>Cambray, Crepy</hi> in <hi>Valois, Chateau en Cambresis,</hi> and <hi>Vervins,</hi> which were all made and concluded out of a pure Effect of the Frank and Free Will of the Princes contracting; which nevertheless confirm'd that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> some in the Whole, and some in Part.</p>

Nevertheless, in regard this Difference has already afforded Matter for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Volumes that have been written on Both sides upon this subject, we shall not undertake to handle it <hi>ex professo,</hi> only we shall lay down the Matter of Fact such as it is; after which, we shall Explain in few Words the State of the Question; without engaging in an Examination, which is usually attended with many Replies and Rejoynders on both sides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip,</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was afterwards the Fourth King of that Name, upon the 18th. of <hi>October,</hi> in the Year 1615. marry'd the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry the Great,</hi> who gave her in Dowry the summ of 500000 Crowns in Gold, and 50000 Crowns in Jewels. Besides this, Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> by way of Augmentation and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made an Addition of One hunder'd sixty six thousand, six hunder'd sixty six Crowns in Gold, making in all seven hunder'd and sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, six hunder'd seventy six thousand Crowns in Gold, which by the Contract of Marriage were declar'd her own, to her and her Heirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dyed the 16th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1644. and left two Children by that Wedlock, Don <hi>Balthazar</hi> and <hi>Maria Teresa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Philip</hi> marrying a second Wife, which was <hi>Maria Ann</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> had by her three Male Children, two of which dy'd young, <hi>Charles</hi> the Third is still living, and at this Day reigning over the Estates of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased King his Father, as the presumptive and only Heir of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. having in the Year 1660: espous'd the Princess <hi>Maria Teresa,</hi> pretended that she was Heiress, and that her Right was Prior to that of her Brother over all the Provinces which we have enumerated at the Beginning of this Chapter; and that, because of a certain Right of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution settl'd in those Countries by Custom. By vertue of which the Children became Proprietors of the Estates of their Father and Mother upon the Decease of either of the two, the Surviver having no Right to sell or engage 'em. The Words of the Custom in <hi>Brabant</hi> upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are these: <hi>If a Man and a Woman have Children, and the one of them happens to dye, by the separation of the Marriage the Propriety of the Fiefs descending in Right of the Longer Liver, passes to the Child or Children born of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46341:24"/> same Marriage, and the Longer Liver has no more then a Ʋsufructuary Right to the same Fiefs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Custom of <hi>Malines</hi> also is more opposite to Fathers and Mothers then that of <hi>Brabant.</hi> For that runs after this manner, <hi>If the Husband or the Wife dye, leaving Children, the Propriety of the Fiefs shall remain to the Children, and the Survivor of the Marry'd Couple shall only have the Moiety of the Ordinary Revenues, over and above the Extraordinary Profits and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty of the Patronage of the Fief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Customs of <hi>Gueldres, Namur, Hainault, Artois</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> are very little different from those which we have cited, and we grant that they concurr all to one end, which is to prefer the Children of the first Venter before those of the second in the Succession to Patrimonies, and to grant 'em the Propriety of 'em after the decease of one of the Marry'd Couple. The Custom of <hi>Burgundy</hi> differs in this, that it gives to all the Children Male or Female an Equal Portion of the Parents Estates; and that of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> allows to the Males in the Partition a Proportion double to that of the Females. So that by vertue of these Customs a third part of <hi>Franche Conte,</hi> and a Fourth part of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> would belong to the Dauphin, in Right of his Mother.</p>
                  <p>As for the Dutchy of <hi>Limburg,</hi> he demands it as a Dependence upon <hi>Brabant,</hi> the Custom of which Country makes for him; it being certain that according to his Laws, all the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> devolv'd to Don <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and <hi>Maria Teresa,</hi> after the Death of their Mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and that by the Decease of Don <hi>Balthazar</hi> which happen'd two Years after, <hi>Maria Teresa,</hi> his Presumptive Heiress, became seiz'd of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the said Countries, the Usufruit remaining only to <hi>Philip,</hi> who dying, ought to have left her the sole Lady and Patroness of All.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, the Dauphin demands the Dowry, the Jewels and the Augmentation of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his Grandmother by the Mother's side; amounting as we have said, to the summ of 716666 Crowns in Gold, as also 500000 Crowns in Gold, granted to his Mother for her Dowry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in all 1216666 Crowns in Gold; besides Arrears, which amount to a vast summ more.</p>
                  <p>These are the Pretended Rights escheated to Monsieur the Dauphin, the Validity of which not being allow'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> his Father began the War in 1667. and entring into <hi>Franche Conte,</hi> seiz'd upon Half of it in less then two Months. However it was restor'd by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapella;</hi> but he retook it in the last War, since which time it could never be regain'd out of the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <head>Enquiries into the New Pretensions of the King of <hi>France</hi> in Right of his Wife, to the Dutchy of <hi>Brabant, Malines, Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>WE read that in former times the Sovereign Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that they might maintain Peace and Union among themselves, set up certain Judges, call'd <hi>Amphyctions,</hi> to whom they referr'd the Amicable Decision of all their Interests. 'Tis an unhappiness that the Princes at this Day ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot, or else are unwilling to doe the same Thing. We should not then behold whole Countries cover'd with Soldiers, the Country-man Ruin'd and Pillag'd, the Citizens overwhelm'd with Taxes and Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Nobility disabl'd from Supporting the Grandeur of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and all <hi>Europe</hi> in general groaning under Oppression and Misery. But what could such weak and impotent Judges doe? for Princes have already a Supream Judge above 'em, whose dreadful Judgments they have reason continually to fear; yet for all that, they will be always making unjust Wars. What then, could Men be able to do that they have neither Force nor Strength to punish? It were rather therefore to be wish'd, that Princes would be Righteous Judges of their own Causes, do Justice one to another, act Sincerely among themselves, and Religiously and Piously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Treaties which they make, and forbear to make such diligent Scrutinies after Frivolous Pretences to break 'em. If the King of <hi>France</hi> had ever well relish'd these Maxims, and made choice of them for the Rule of his Conduct, he would never have set up these Pretensions to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Crown, after the Death of the King, who in all outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is not like to have any Children, much less be liable to any such Forfeitures of his Rights in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> He cannot be said to have any Shame or Moderation to go so palpably and so directly against a Treaty so solemn and so sacred as the Contract of his Marriage, within Five or Six Years after it was concluded. Let his Admirers say what they please, the King of <hi>France</hi> can never justifie a Proceeding so unjust. Had not the Dispute been in his Reign, but that the Dauphin only had gone about to re-demand his Mother's Rights, it would not have been altogether so Strange. But for Him Himself who made the Agreements, who worded every Article so punctually as not to leave the least occasion for any doubt, and caus'd 'em to be ratify'd in all his Courts of Justice throughout his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for him to retract from what he had agreed to, and relinquish'd, and to declare to all the World, that at the time when he treated and made his Concessions, that 'twas only with a design to stand to nothing of Treaty and Agreement, and to cheat his Father-in-law and his Uncle, is a Thing that would hardly be believ'd, were not the Sun it self a Witness of it. But that we may come close to the matter, it behoves us to let the Reader know, that the Question consists in two Principal Points. The first is, Whether the Infanta <hi>Maria Teresa</hi> were really and <hi>de facto</hi> Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Lady of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and whether the Right of Devolution
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46341:25"/> were in Her: And the second, Whether the Renunciation which She and the King of <hi>France</hi> made, be of any force.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a wonderful thing, that the <hi>French,</hi> who so loudly cry up the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Impossibility of dividing the Estates particularly in their own Right, yet would absolutely destroy the Right of <hi>Spain,</hi> by subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her King to the Local Customs of Countries that depend upon their Crown, as if the Sovereign of so spacious, so puissant and so August a Monarchy were oblig'd to be govern'd by the By-Laws of a thousand Petty Jurisdictions that are subject to it. For if they will not admit of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in Custom, with respect of the Members to the Body of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, no more is it to be admitted with respect of the Parts of the Members to the Whole, and by that means in two or three Generations, the most Potent Kingdoms will be divided into above a hunder'd Parcels. This, if you would believe 'em, would be the True way in a short time to make <hi>France</hi> the Mistriss of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of all the World, for that she would have the only Privilege never to be divided. Nothing is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable as this Proposal, nor do's it deserve a Refutation. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that they may not ground any Pretence upon our Silence, we must say, That Customs are no other then a Usage establish'd by particular Persons, with the Permission and Good Will of the Prince, and which in process of Time obtains the force of a Law among 'em; but not in regard of the Sovereign, to whom Subjects have no Right to prescribe Laws. So that when ever such Laws are reduc'd to a Settlement, 'tis always done by the Prince's Permission, and they have all along reserv'd their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Right and Authority. As is notoriously to be seen in that of <hi>Lovain,</hi> wherein the King makes this Reservation, <hi>without Prejudice to the Kings Rights and Prerogatives:</hi> and in that of <hi>Brabant,</hi> wherein this Clause is inserted, <hi>without Prejudice to our Prerogative and Authority.</hi> 'Tis in vain then to urge these Customs, and to deduce from Them a Right to dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Dominions of the Most Catholick King. The Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> has her Customs, whereby the Males are preferr'd before the Females in the Succession to the whole Monarchy, which is not to be divided. If they ask me for a Copy of this Custom; we answer, 'tis written upon the Back of the Original of the <hi>Salick Law,</hi> and much clearer in History, which has confirm'd this Truth beyond all Contradiction. Since then this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has been always observ'd, why would they have the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to alter it now, in favour of the King of <hi>France.</hi> Is he so much beholding to him, that he should so liberally give him his Dominions, and alienate his Estates to advance the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy?</p>
                  <p>The Injustice of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Pretensions, is so much the more visible by how much they appear to be ill concerted. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, as he do's, that Princes ought to regulate themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Customs of the Countries to which they desire to succeed, why do's he demand the Dutchy of <hi>Limburg, Antwerp, Brussells,</hi> the Country of <hi>Rien,</hi> the Territory of <hi>Turnhout, Hoock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straten,</hi> and <hi>Nivelle,</hi> the Customs of which Countries are directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to him? And if he pretends, that all those Places being Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon the Dutchy of <hi>Brabant</hi> ought to follow the Customs of that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46341:26"/> Dutchy, why will he not that the same Dutchy, being a Dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> should be inherited and held according to the Customs of <hi>Spain?</hi> This speaks it self without any need of a Commentary. But let us suppose for a minute, that the Succession to <hi>Philip</hi> IV. in <hi>Brabant,</hi> ought to have been regulated according to the particular Customs of that Country, in what History is it to be found that the Daughters of the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enter, or otherwise, were ever preferr'd before the Males in the Succession to that Dukedom: there is not so much as one single Example of it. This is then a New Law which the King of <hi>France</hi> would fain introduce into the Dominions of his Catholick Majesty: but it is too unjust to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. What Kingdom in the World was ever so regulated? We know very well that there are several wherein the Females are excluded from the Government; because that Sex indeed is rarely capable of supporting the Burthen of Affairs, but never were they preferr'd before the Males. This is to go directly against Sense and Reason, and to overturn the Order of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Then let <hi>France</hi> surcease to urge her pretended Right of Devolution, and to impose upon the <hi>Brabanders,</hi> by going about to perswade 'em, that she only acts in the defence of her particular Laws and Customs. She only makes use of that Pretence to gain their Country, and would overturn 'em to preserve it. She upholds, as she pretends, this Right in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: but her Intentions are afterwards to destroy it, to their Ruine, by incorporating <hi>Brabant</hi> into her Crown for ever; and then we should see after what manner she would mannage the Right of Devolution.</p>
                  <p>To all that we have said, we must farther add, That we may stop the Mouths of the French, who at any rate would have it, that the Customs of <hi>Brabant</hi> should be observ'd, that this Devolution is not so indispensably observ'd, but that the Children may renounce it in favour of a second Marriage of their Father or Mother; which is a Thing that happens every day.</p>
                  <p>Let us now proceed to the Second Point, which concerns the Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation made to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> by the K. of <hi>France</hi> and the Queen his Wife, in favour of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. by their Contract of Marriage. Never was Treaty more Authentick, nor of greater Importance. The Grand Business of it was, to restore Union and a good Understanding between two Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates that had been a long time at Variance; to put an end to a Cruel War which could not prove otherwise then fatal to one of the two Kingdoms, and perhaps to Both, to terminate the Disputes that were the occasion of it; and lastly, to lay the Foundations of a lasting and solid Peace, which by establishing a good Correspondence between the two Kingdoms, might settle 'em in Plenty and Tranquillity. And in regard that woful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, together with the Different Interests of the two Princes, made both afraid, least instead of a Firm and Lasting Peace, it should only prove a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms to recover Breath, and gather Strength for new Vexations of each other, 'twas thought the Only Expedient to fortifie and assure a long and durable Peace by a Matrimonial Alliance between the two Crowns. Thereupon a Match was propos'd between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Infanta <hi>Maria Teresa;</hi> but there was an Obstacle almost unsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46341:26"/> that lay in the way; the Law of <hi>Spain</hi> not permitting an Alienation of the Kingdom, nor that it should fall under the Dominion of a Stranger, which however might so fall out, if <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. marry'd the Infanta without Conditions. For in case that <hi>Charles</hi> II. dy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue Male, <hi>Spain,</hi> of a Monarchy, as it was, would come to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>France.</hi> Moreover, 'tis well known to all the World of what high Importance it is, not only to the Welfare of <hi>Spain,</hi> but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to prevent the Conjunction of those two Kingdoms in one: which being consider'd and well understood by the two Kings, they resolv'd by consent to remove that Obstacle by an Express and Authentick Renunciation to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> After which, the Match was propos'd to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who finding that instead of one Crown very uncertain whether it would descend to her or no, she should immediately enjoy another, and that by such an Act of Self-denyal, she should procure Peace to her Country, without ever hesitating, consented to the Renunciation which was desir'd of her. This is barely and really the true state of the Matter of Fact without welt or guard; and this Renunciation was the Chief End and Foundation of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty, without which, neither the Renunciation could have been made, nor could the Match have gone forward. It was then a Publick Treaty, in order to the Welfare and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of two Kingdoms, and the Establishment of a Peace, of which the Marriage of the Infanta was as it were the Seal or Pledge. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, the French would shake off this Renunciation by the Rubricks of the Palace, as a Petty Bargain of Four Sous concern, between Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And upon this Principle they alledge the Roman Law, the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Emperors, and the Sentiments of some Doctors, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn these sorts of Renunciations. But they vainly go about to make this Treaty pass for an Act <hi>Stricti juris,</hi> agreed between Private and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Persons, or of a Daughter to a Father. It was not only a Sincere Contract but a Publick Treaty, which concern'd the Publick, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with the Publick, in behalf of which, King <hi>Philip</hi> undertook to make a solemn Agreement. Otherwise we must say, that the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> the States depending upon it, and all Persons, of what quality or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever that compose it, are the King's peculiar and private Estate, which would make him a Tyrant instead of a Lawful Prince. Let us agree then, that the Publick Interest was the Chief subject of this Treaty, for the good of which the King and the Infanta his Daughter prudently and like Christians provided by means of an Act which secur'd <hi>Spain</hi> from falling under the Dominion of a Stranger to the prejudice and detriment of her Fundamental Laws and Liberty.</p>
                  <p>This being lay'd down and granted for a certain. Truth, they must grant us another, which is no less clear nor less solid; That the Renunciation, the Contract of Marriage, and the Ratifications and Powers that preceded or follow'd it, cannot be subjected to the Wranglings of the Bar, nor to any written Law, but only to the Law of God, the Law of Nature and of Nations; from the Bottom of which, all these Acts have drawn their Constitution and their Substance. The Law of God authorizes 'em, for that by preventing and obviating those Wars, which of necessity would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46341:27"/> have ensu'd, if this Renunciation had not been the Foundation of those Acts, they would have prevented an Infinite Number of Robberies, Murders, Rapes, Blasphemies, Sacrileges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are inseparable from War. The Law of Nature supports 'em, seeing that by removing Strangers for ever from the Crown, it procures the Enjoyment of it to the real Princes of the Blood, and to those of the same Nation, and as we have said, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a world of Murders and Disorders of the same Nature. The Law of Nations not only approves 'em, but gives 'em all their Strength and Force, since it is the warrant for all publick Acts that are made for the general Good of Society. Vainly therefore doe the French attack with the Rubricks of <hi>Bartholus,</hi> such sacred Treaties as these, which were the Unanimous Dictates of Nature, Piety and Affection for our Native Country.</p>
                  <p>Not, but that if we design'd to defend our selves with the same Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which they make use of to attack us, we could not only ward off their Blows, but employ 'em offensively with Success. For every Thing speaks in defence of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Canon and Civil Law, the Law both written and unwritten, and if they were silent, the very Stones would Speak in so Just a Cause. We cite 'em therefore rather to stop their Mouths, then for any farther Support of a Right alreadly so sufficiently prov'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true that the Roman Law and the Constitutions of the Emperors are expresly contrary to the Renunciations of Children; but when the main Dispute is about an Affair of so great Importance as this, it behoves us to penetrate to the very Bottom of the Laws, and without stopping at the Outward Rind, to examine the Reasons which induc'd those Legislators to frame their Decrees in that manner. That we may understand 'em then, it behoves us to observe that the Renunciations of Children to the Successions of their Fathers and Mothers, are of two sorts. The one in favour of a Father or Brothers, the other in favour of Strangers. As to the first, there was an absolute necessity of applying a Remedy to it, because the same Laws having granted to Fathers the Power of Life and Death over their Children, by that Constitution had put a means into their Hands to force 'em to whatever they thought fit to exact from 'em. And because it is usual to see Parents more particularly and more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately enclin'd to some of their Children then others, 'tis certain that many would have made use of their Sovereign Authority to force those for whom they had the least Kindness to relinquish their Titles for the benefit of their best belov'd: and in regard the Law it self had been the Occasion of these Disorders, 'twas necessary to apply a Remedy to 'em, that so the Renunciations of Children in favour of their Parents might be of no Validity. Now in regard the Renunciation in question is of the same nature; and that the Part of that Law which gave occasion to the other, by granting to the Fathers an Absolute Power over the Lives of their Children is abolish'd, it follows that the other part which was Enacted in consequence of it, should be disannull'd in like manner. It only then remains for us to know whether it were Effectually cancell'd: but that Question will not admit of the least Scruple, seeing that the Customs of <hi>Brabant</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46341:27"/> and <hi>Spain</hi> perfectly agree in that particular, the Renunciations of Daughters in favour of the Fathers commonly taking place, provided they be of Age and of sufficient discretion; and this for a farther Surplusage of Right was confirm'd by the Decretal of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. which not being any new Constitution, but only an Explanation of the Civil Law has declar'd, <hi>That every Renunciation made upon Oath by a Daughter above</hi> 12 <hi>Years of Age, in favour of her Father in order to a Contract of Marriage, by which a sufficient Dowry is assign'd her, ought to be good in Law, tho' she be then under the Jurisdiction of her Father.</hi> After a Decision so clear as this, we cannot but wonder that Men should be so Scrutinous after Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges. For in short, all the Conditions requir'd in the Bull, are to be met with in the Queen's Renunciation. She was of Age, for that instead of being above Twelve Years of Age, she was above Twenty: She had a Sufficient Dowry, seeing that neither the Kings of <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Spain</hi> were wont to give more then she had: and besides all that, it cannot be said that she was any way injur'd by that Renunciation, in regard that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing the remote and uncertain Hopes of one Crown, she gain'd another immediately no less glorious and flourishing then her own in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Tis to no purpose then to alleage the Estates that she lost, seeing she was a Gainer of others that were more Considerable, and that according to the Law, <hi>damno Vitando, &amp; lucro Captando,</hi> there is no Injury done. But if the <hi>French,</hi> without any regard to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>'s Decretal, nor to the Customs of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> nor to the Sentiments of the greatest part of their Doctors, will solely rely upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, let 'em then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the last Will and Testament of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. by which he disposes of the Kingdom conformably to the Renunciation of the Infanta his Daughter. And the Right of Testatorship was so generally admitted among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and also held for so sacred, that there was not one, of which they had a more Religious Opinion in all their Pandects. If after all that we have said, they want Examples, we shall only produce five or six among a thousand that History affords us. <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> upon his Death-Bed, left his Crown to his Brother <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to the Exclusion of his Sons, because he did not think 'em capable of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him. <hi>David</hi> for the like Reason excluded <hi>Adonias</hi> from the Throne, and gave it to <hi>Solomon</hi> his younger Son. <hi>Raboam</hi> did the same in favour of his Son <hi>Abdias:</hi> Don <hi>Jaimo,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> substituted his Nephews in the room of his deceased Sons, to the Exclusion of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Don <hi>Pedro</hi> III. and Don <hi>Pedro</hi> IV. did as much. Thus you see sufficient Proof of what concerns the King's last Will and Testament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Infanta's Renunciation. It is confirm'd by a hunder'd Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Examples. <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> the Eldest Son of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> left the Kingdom to his Brother <hi>Pepin: John,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; Queen <hi>Christina</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> did the same. And that we may not quit the House of <hi>Austria, Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Philip</hi> II. did they not abdicate after the same manner? But we perceive that these Examples will not satisfie 'em; they must have Renunciations the same in Fact, and in the same Case; and we have here two for 'em. <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Naples,</hi> was the Heiress of that Crown; nevertheless
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46341:28"/> she renounc'd her Right, both for her self and her Heirs, by her Contract of Marriage with <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip the Bold,</hi> for all her Dowry, bringing no more to that Prince, then the Earldoms of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Main,</hi> which he enjoy'd before; so that indeed she brought him nothing. But wherefore do we go so far a Field to search for that, which we may find in our own Age, and in the Families also of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi> All the World knows, that when <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. marry'd <hi>Mary Ann,</hi> Sister to <hi>Philip</hi> III. that Princess, joyntly with her Husband, renounc'd their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the same Terms, and upon the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that his Niece and her Daughter-in-Law did afterwards. This is a thing publickly known; and seeing that at that time there was not a word said against that Renunciation, they have as little reason do do it at this day. The only doubt then, that can now remain in the Mind of our Readers not well instructed in this Affair, is to understand whether the Renunciations of the Infanta <hi>Maria Teresa,</hi> and King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. were really Exact, Authentick, and no way subject to Explanation. For which Reason we have deem'd it convenient, for their Satisfaction, to insert here the Contract of Marriage, at length; together with the Ratification of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the most Essential Articles of the Queen's Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; as also of the Last Will of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. not believing it necessary to pester this small Volume with the two last Acts entire, nor with the Orders for their being enregister'd in the Parlament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Chamber of Accounts, and Court of Aids, though they were there recorded with all the usual Formalities.</p>

                  <p>THAT with the Grace and Blessing of God, a Dispensation being first obtain'd from his Holiness, by reason of the Proximity of Blood and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity which is between the Most Christian King and the Most Serene Infanta, they cause their Espousals and Marriage to be celebrated by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Promise, according to the Form and Solemnity prescribed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canons and Constitutions of the Catholick, Apostolick, and Roman Church; and the said Espousals and Marriage shall be made in the Court

And the Conclusion and Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the said Marriage, whether by special Power or in Presence, shall be made, when and at the time concerted and agreed upon between Their Majesties.</p>
                  <p>THAT his Catholick Majesty promises and stands oblig'd to give, and shall give to the Most Serene Infanta, Dona <hi>MARIA THERESA,</hi> in Dowry, and in Favour of the Marriage with the Most Christian King of <hi>France,</hi> and pay to his Most Christian Majesty, or to the Person who shall have Power and Commission from him, the Summ of Five hunder'd thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in Gold, or their just Value in the City of <hi>Paris;</hi> and the said Summ shall be paid in the following manner. The Third Part, at the time of the Consummation of the Marriage. The other Third, at the Year's End, after the Consummation; and the last Third Part, Six Months after. So that the full Payment of the said Summ of Five hunder'd thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in Gold, or their just Value, shall be made in Eighteen Months time, at the Terms, and according to the Proportions already specify'd.</p>
                  <p>THAT his Most Christian Majesty obliges himself to settle, and shall settle a Joynture to the Most Serene Infanta, Dona <hi>MARIA THERESA,</hi> upon good and secure Rents, and upon valuable Funds and Assignations to the Satisfaction of his Catholick Majesty, or of the Persons whom he shall nominate for that purpose, proportionably, and as his said Majesty shall receive the said Five hundred thousand Crowns in Gold, or their just Value, within the Terms above-mention'd; and shall as speedily send to his Catholick Majesty the Acts of the said Assignation and Consignation of Rents. And in case of a Dissolution of the Marriage, and that of Right the Restitution of the Dowry takes place, it shall be restor'd to the Most Serene Infanta, or to the Person who shall have Power or Claim from her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and during the time that the said Dowry shall remain unrestor'd, her Highness, or her Heirs and Successors, shall enjoy Revenues to the full Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the said Five hunder'd thousand Pounds in Gold, at the Rate of the Twentieth Penny, which shall be paid by virtue of the said Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>THAT upon the full and effectual Payment of the said Five hunder'd thousand Crowns in Gold, or their just Value, to his Most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, at the Terms above specify'd, the Most Serene Infanta shall account herself satisfy'd, and shall be satisfy'd with the said Dowry; and shall content her self with the said Dowry, in such manner, that it shall not be in her Power, at any time afterwards, to start any other Right or Claim of hers, or to commence any other Suit or Demands, upon Pretence that there belongs or may belong to her any other greater Estates, Rights, Reck'nings or Actions, by reason of larger Inheritances and Successions of their Catholick Majesties, her Father and Mother, nor by any Wager of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46341:29"/> Law grounded upon their Persons, nor in any other manner, nor for any Cause or Claim whatever, whether she know it, or be ignorant of it; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of whatever Quality and Condition the said Actions and Things above-mention'd are, she ought to stand excluded from 'em. And before the Accomplishment of the Espousals, she shall make a Renunciation in good and due Form, and with all the Assurances, Forms and Solemnities that are requisite and necessary. Which said Renunciation she shall make before her being marry'd by present Promise, and which immediately after the Marriage, she shall approve and ratifie joyntly with the Most Christian King, with the same Forms and Solemnities which she made use of at her first Renunciation aforesaid; that is to say, with those Clauses as shall be judg'd most convenient and necessary. To the Performance and Accomplishment of which Renunciation, his Most Christian Majesty and her Highness, shall remain and do remain from this time forward as then oblig'd. And in case she shall not perform the said Renunciation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, by virtue of this Contract by Capitulation, the said agreed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation and Ratification shall be held and adjudg'd, from this time forward, as then, for well and duly Perform'd, Pass'd and Ordain'd. Which shall be done in the most Authentick and most Effectual Form that may be, that so they may be Firm and Valid, together with all the Clauses derogating from the Derogatories of any Jurisdiction, Custom, Privileges and Constitutions contrary to this Act, or which may hinder, in whole or in part, the said Renunciations and Ratifications. From all which particular and derogatory Customs and Jurisdictions, for the more effectual Confirmation of the above-mention'd Renunciations and Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, their Most Christian and Catholick Majesties shall derogate, and will from this present absolutely derogate. And for their Approbation and Ratification of this present Contract, from this time forth, as then it shall be understood, and is understood, that they have derogated from all those Exceptions above-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>THAT for as much as their Most Christian and Catholick Majesties are come and do come to conclude a Marriage, in order to the perpetuating and securing, by means of this Tie of Affection, the publick Peace of Christendom, and between their Majesties, that Love and Amity which every Body hopes there is between 'em; as also in Consideration of the just and lawful Causes which demonstrate and persuade the Equality and Conveniency of the said Marriage; by means of which, and through the Favour and Grace of God, every Body may hope from these happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, the great Benefit and Encrease of the Christian Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Common Welfare and Prosperity of both Kingdoms, the Subjects and Vassals of both Crowns. As also, for what concerns and imports the Good of the Republick, and the Preservation of the Two Crowns; which being so great and Puissant, they cannot be united into One, and that from henceforward the Occasions of such a Conjunction may be prevented; Therefore, considering the Quality of the Subject, and other just Reasons, more-specially that of Equality, which ought to be preserv'd, Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Agree and Ordain, by Contract, and Covenanted Compact between themselves, which shall issue forth and obtain the Place, Force and Vigour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46341:30"/> of a Firm and Establish'd Law forever, in Favour of their Kingdoms, and for the Common Welfare of Both, That the most Serene Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> Dona <hi>MARIA THERESA,</hi> and the Children begot of her Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Male or Female, and their Posterity, First or Second, Third or Fourth Generation born after her, in what Degree soever they may be, that is to say, for ever, neither can succeed, nor may succeed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Estates, Signiories and Dominions which belong or shall belong to his Catholick Majesty, and which are comprehended under the Titles and Qualities mention'd in this present Capitulation; nor to any of his other Kingdoms, Estates, Signiories, Provinces, adjacent Islands, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainships, nor to the Frontiers which his Catholick Majesty possesses at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or which do or may belong to him, as well within as without the Kingdom of <hi>Spain;</hi> and which, for the future, his Catholick Majesty, or his Successors, shall have or possess, or which shall belong to him or them, nor to any that are comprehended in these, or depend upon 'em; nor to any of those which hereafter, at any time whatever, may accrue to him, or which he may acquire or add to his said Kingdoms, Estates and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or which he may regain, or which may escheat to him by Devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by any other Title, or Right, or Reason whatever, though it were during the Life of the said Most Serene Infanta, Dona <hi>MARY THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RESA,</hi> or after her Death, in the Life-time of any of her Off-spring, First, Second, Third born, or further, whereby any Ground or Grounds in Law, by which either of Right, or by the Laws and Customs of the said Kingdoms, Estates or Dominions, or by the Disposals of Titles, by which they might succeed, or pretend to succeed to the said Kingdoms, Estates or Dominions, may be said to belong to them. From the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in all which Cases, the said Dona <hi>MARIA THERESA</hi> says and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares her self to be from henceforward excluded, and to remain truly and lawfully excluded, together with all her Children and Posterity, Male or Female, though they would or could say or pretend, that in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, neither the said Reasons of State, nor any others upon which the said Exclusion might be grounded, could be of force, or could or ought to be consider'd; or that they should alledge, (which God forbid,) That the Succession of the Catholick King, or his Most Serene Princes or Infants, and abundance of Males which he has, and may have for his Lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, were fail'd and extinct. Because that, as has already been said, in no case, nor at any time, nor in any manner that may happen, neither She nor They, their Heirs and Posterity, have any thing to do with the Succession, nor to pretend a Power to succeed in any of the said Kingdoms, States and Signiories. As also, notwithstanding all the Laws and Customs of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which to the Exclusion of the Successors to that Crown, oppose themselves to the above-mention'd Exclusion, as well at present, as for the Time to come, and to the Cases which would have a long time time delay'd the said Successions. Upon which Considerations joyn'd together, and every one in particular, their said Majesties abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate whatever they contradict or impeach being contain'd in this Contract, and whatever may hinder the Accomplishment and Execution thereof. And that for the Approbation and Ratification of this present Capitulation,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46341:30"/> they derogate from all things prejudicial to it, and hold 'em as derogated from they also will and mean, that the Most Serene Infanta and her Posterity, shall for the future, and forever stand and remain Excluded from Succeeding at any time or in any case to the Estates of the Country of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> their Appurtenances and Dependencies. In like manner they also declare most expresly, That in case the Most Serene Infanta happen to be a Widow (which God forbid) without Children by this Marriage, that she shall be free and discharg'd from this Exclusion, and declar'd a Person capable of her Rights, and may succeed to all that may belong to her, or Escheat to her in two Cases only; the one, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a Widow of this Marriage without Children, she return into <hi>Spain.</hi> The other, if for reasons of State, for the Publick Good, and upon just Considerations, she Marry again with the Good Will of her Father the Catholick King or the Prince her Brother. In which two Cases she shall be capable to succeed and inherit.</p>
                  <p>THAT the Most Serene Infanta, Dona <hi>Maria Theresa,</hi> before the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Marriage by present Promise, shall give, promise and grant a Writing, by which she shall engage as well for her self as for her Heirs and Successors, to accomplish and perform all and every thing above written, in reference to her Exclusion, and that of her Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and shall approve the whole, as it is contain'd in this Capitulation, with requisite and necessary Clauses and Oaths. And at the Inserting the above-mention'd Obligation and Ratification which her Highness shall have given and made to this present Capitulation, she shall make another of the same nature, and like this, jointly with the Most Christian King, so soon as she shall be Espous'd and Married, which shall be Register'd in the Parlament of <hi>Paris</hi> according to the accustom'd Form, with other Necessary Clauses. As also on the Part of his Catholick Majesty, he shall approve and Ratifie the Renunciation in the Accustom'd Form and Force with other Necessary Clauses. And whether the said Renunciations, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications and Approbations be made or not made; from hence forward by vertue of this present Capitulation and the Marriage which shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, and in Consideration of all the Things above-mention'd, they shall be held and adjudg'd for well and duly made and consented to, and for past and Register'd in the Parlament of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Publication of the Peace in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT his Most Christian Majesty shall give to the Most Serene Infanta Dona <hi>Maria Theresa</hi> the value of 50000 Crowns in Gold in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THAT his Most Christian Majesty according to the Ancient and most Laudable Custom of the House of <hi>France,</hi> shall assign and appoint to her Highness the Infanta Dona <hi>Maria Theresa</hi> for her Jointure Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in Gold every Year, which shall be assign'd upon Revenues and Lands where there shall be power of Administring Justice, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Place of which shall bear the Title of a <hi>Dutchy,</hi> and Successively

                  </p>
                  <p>THAT his Most Christian Majesty shall give and assign to the Most Serene Infanta Dona <hi>Maria Theresa,</hi> for the Expence of her Chamber, and the Support of her State and Houshold, a Convenient Summ, such as is proper and suitable for the Wife and Daughter of two such Great and Potent Kings, assigning it in such Form and Manner as Assignations are usually made in <hi>France</hi> for such like Expences.</p>
                  <p>THAT the Most Christian King, and the Most Serene Infanta Dona <hi>Maria Theresa,</hi> shall be espous'd and marry'd by a Proxy, whom the Most Christian King shall send to the Most Serene Infanta, by present Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.

                  <p>THe King of <hi>France</hi> has in some measure desisted from these last Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, nevertheless, because it is the humour of his Council never to Renounce, but only to Surcease and Prorogue his Interests, whether true or false, and for that there is no question to be made, but that when an Opportunity serves, they will set 'em again on foot, we thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to place 'em in an Article that will conclude this Paragraph.</p>

Lastly, That his Most Christian Majesty, from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest till the Peace, Exercis'd within these Countries all the Rights of Sovereignty which he enjoys in other Places, that from all Antiquity have been subject to his Jurisdiction, or which he had acquir'd beyond all Contradiction by Force of his Arms, during the Course of the War.</q>

                  <p>After this, He fills up several Pages, to prove that during the Course of the War, the King of <hi>France</hi> has rul'd in the Country as King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and says at length, <q>That they are willing in Conformity to what his Catholick Majesty's Proctor desires, to Stick to what was precisely Stipulated; and so 'tis for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to make it out that there were any Covenants on his part, for the Restitution of the Castellanship of <hi>Alost,</hi> of the Old Borough of <hi>Gand,</hi> and other Places mention'd in the Declaration of the 4th. of <hi>August.</hi>

                  <p>THe Result of this Extract and of his Most Christian Majesty's Proctor, is in few Words, <hi>I have got Possession by Force of Arms; I have kept it during the War, by Force of Arms: And I resolve to keep it after the Peace.</hi> For in short, it is ridiculous to say, That because there is nothing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted in particular about the Restitution of the Places, that therefore the King of <hi>France</hi> has a Right to preserve 'em, or rather to keep 'em by force. It being certain, that even in the most Violent Heat of the War, this Country which lies open on every side, and which cannot be call'd other then the Flat Country; was no otherwise in subjection to the French, then as usually are all those open Countries where the Enemy is at Liberty to range and exact Contributions; and that in all the Jurisdictions the Authority of the Catholick King was acknowledg'd before that of the Most Christian; particularly at <hi>Gramont, Ninove, Lessines</hi> and <hi>Florbee,</hi> where Justice was always administer'd in his Name, and from whence they always appeal'd to <hi>Brussells</hi> and <hi>Malines;</hi> so far were the Magistrates and the Nobility from Swearing Fidelity to the Most Christian King, as is pretended and asserted. But tho' it were so, what Title could be inferr'd from an unwilling Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, pay'd by Subjects who are forc'd to obey, not with the dry Cudgel only over their Shoulders, but with the Naked Sword and Flaming Torch before their Doors?</p>
                  <p>The Pretensions of the King of <hi>France,</hi> are not in this case supported so much as with the least Shadow of Dependencies, which he has render'd so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He acknowledges that none of these Castellanships, Cities and Villages are under the Jurisdiction of the Cities that have been relinquish'd to him; nevertheless he has a long time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted to demand 'em, and to pretend to 'em, for no other reason but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46341:34"/> the Country which lies open on every side, has suffer'd during the whole War, the Vexations and Violences of his Soldiers, and for that on the other side, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who look'd upon 'em as his Ancient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, us'd 'em with the mildness of a Gentle Prince, and assisted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected 'em as much as lay in his power.</p>

                  <p>AFter the Fall of the Roman Empire, <hi>Liguria</hi> was annex'd to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> of which it was a Province till the Year 795. at what time <hi>Charlemain</hi> having defeated <hi>Didier,</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> conquer'd the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> as well as the rest of <hi>Italy,</hi> except <hi>Venice.</hi> He plac'd a Governour there, whose Name was <hi>Ademar,</hi> and to render his Jurisdiction more Considerable, he added to it the Island of <hi>Corsu,</hi> which belongs at this day to the <hi>Genoeses.</hi> From this Conquest it is, that the King of <hi>France</hi> derive his first Title to <hi>Genoa,</hi> as Successor to <hi>Charlemain,</hi> whose whole Monarchy he looks upon as his own.</p>
                  <p>His Second Title is deduc'd from hence, that in the Year 1390. the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses</hi> finding themselves hard press'd upon by the <hi>Venetians</hi> their usual Enemies, they had recourse to <hi>Charles</hi> VI.

Upon which he sent his General <hi>Boncicaut</hi> with a Powerful Army, who beat the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and afterwards receiv'd the Homage of this City in the Name of <hi>Charles,</hi> his Master.</p>
                  <p>This Dependance upon the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to which the <hi>Genoeses</hi> by a voluntary Act, submitted, that so they might be succour'd against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> was confirm'd and renew'd in the Year 1458. For that fearing to fall under the Servitude of the <hi>Moors,</hi> or to be subdu'd by the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> they sent <hi>Peter Frogosa</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> VII. with a Request that he would once more take their City into his Protection, and succour 'em against their Enemies, and withal to promise in their Names, Fidelity and Acknowledgment. <hi>Charles,</hi> who desir'd nothing so much, consented to their Submission, and sent <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to receive their Oath of Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>But in regard the <hi>Genoeses</hi> are Extreamly Turbulent, and Great Lovers of Change, they soon broke all their Engagements which they had made with <hi>France,</hi> and shaking off the <hi>French</hi> Yoke, expell'd the Garrison, and pretended to be absolutely Free and Independent. But this lasted not

And if I am not mistaken <hi>Frogosa</hi> and <hi>Grimaldi</hi> were the Commissioners, who protested to the King, That for the future they would be more Constant and Faithful in their Obedience. However, <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Humour, gave 'em but a very bad Reception at first, <hi>Come hither,</hi> said he, <hi>hold up your Hands and Swear, Are you entrusted by the Signiory, or no?</hi>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. his Son, in like manner, invested in it <hi>Lodowick Sforza</hi> in 1484. who did Homage for it in his own Person, <hi>Charles</hi> refusing a very Considerable Summ, which <hi>Lodowick</hi> offer'd him, that he might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doe it by a Proxy. But after his Death, the <hi>Genoeses</hi> revolted again, and with greater Fury then before. For they not only broke down the Arms of <hi>France</hi> that were set up in several parts of the City, but they cut the Throats of the Garrison; and erected a new Form of Government among themselves, from which they Excluded the Nobility with that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that by a Law which they made, before they could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Dignities and Employ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

This Change, as well you may believe, was not without pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences. There was a great deal of Blood spilt in the City by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Factions that were in it, and much more when <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it with all his Forces. The Siege lasted two Months, at the End of which, having taken the Town, he caus'd the New Duke to be hang'd, and enter'd in at the Breach, in compleat Armour, with his Sword in his Hand, as if he had intended to have put all the Inhabitants to the Sword. However he met no Body in the Streets, for they were all fled into the Grand Piazza, where he found 'em in the greatest Terror and Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the World. So soon as they beheld him, they threw themselves upon the Ground, crying out, <hi>Mercy,</hi> after so pitiful a manner, that the Victor was touch'd with Compassion, and pardon'd 'em. Nevertheless, for their Punishment, he took from 'em their Privilege of Coining Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and impos'd a Governor upon 'em. This happen'd in the Year 1506. But whether it were their Natural Inconstancy, or that the French Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion were so severe, that they who had not been accustom'd to it, could
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46341:35"/> not brook it, certain it is, that about 25 or 30 Years after that, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly expell'd the French, and settl'd their Government upon new Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as now it stands. For tho' the General had at first reduc'd 'em to Obedience, yet upon his departure for <hi>Naples, Andrew Doria,</hi> who had left the French Service, as not being Recompenc'd to his mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to recover the Liberty of his Country; which he accomplish'd at last with the Assistance of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> whom he caus'd the Republick to acknowledge; and ever since that time it has been Free.</p>

                  <p>CErtain it is, that Donations so often repeated, are to be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Justest Claims that can be urg'd. We have sufficiently prov'd it already, and therefore we conceive it not requisite to handle this Question over again. Only we must say, that these Donations have been practis'd in all Ages, and approv'd in Sacred Scripture, as may be seen in the Books of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus.</hi> 'Tis also true, that after a Solemn and Voluntary Donation, more-especially when it was attended with a Safe Protection, there is no withdrawing from it, without incurring the Crimes of Rebellion and Felony: but all this no way supports the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of <hi>France.</hi> Now to make a Solid Judgment of the Matter, we must go back to the Spring Head, whether it were in the Power of the <hi>Genoeses</hi> to give themselves to the King of <hi>France.</hi> 'Tis Evident then that they could not. Seeing that from the time that they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by <hi>Charlemain,</hi> they became Members of the Empire, from which they were never separated since, neither under the Reign of <hi>Lewis the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair,</hi> nor that of <hi>Lothaires,</hi> nor any other of the Emperors that reign'd since them, to the Year 1324. at what time out of their Natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they alter'd their Government, and made choice of a Particular Duke among themselves, who was <hi>Dominico Fregoza.</hi> Nevertheless, they did not absolutely separate from the Empire, but they pretended not to acknowledge it for the future, but under the Title of Protection: and because they could have been glad not to have held of it all, and yet were afraid of being Outlaw'd, they thought they could not take a better Course, then to shrowd themselves under the Protection of <hi>France.</hi> This was their Policy in their first Insurrection. But in regard that as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Subjects of the Empire, they were oblig'd to keep themselves fix'd to it, neither had they any Right to withdraw themselves from it. So that their Voluntary Donation, which had been very good and Equitable, had it been made by free People, can be look'd upon as no other then an Attempt against the Emperor and the Empire, and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Rebellion, because they were Natural Subjects. For it signifies nothing for the French to say, That the Empire is a Dependence upon their Crown. For, First, the Proposition is absurd in it self, and then the Contrary visibly appears by the Partition which <hi>Lewis the Pious</hi> made among his Children, and the Arbitrary Sentence that confirm'd it afterward. Which being laid down and acknowledg'd, who is there that do's not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46341:36"/> readily perceive the Nullity of the French Sovereignty over the <hi>Genoeses;</hi> and that when at the Instigation of <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> they Expell'd the French out of their Territories, they did but return and submit themselves to their Obedience under their Real Sovereign, who had always preserv'd his Rights, maugre their Rebellion, which was well acknowledg'd by all the World, that in the Year 1559. the Marquis of <hi>Final,</hi> who had been Expell'd by 'em out of his Dominions, cited 'em to appear before the Emperor that he might obtain Restitution, tho' they were then under the Protection of <hi>France;</hi> and because they refus'd to submit to the Sentence which he gave, he threaten'd 'em with the Imperial Outlawry, which had been Effectually done, had they not at length return'd to their Duty.</p>

But after his Death, he remain'd Lord and Master of it, in Right of his Wife <hi>Clotilda,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Gondebaud,</hi> who dy'd without Issue: and after that, it was never divided more from the House of <hi>France,</hi> tho' it had been given several times in <hi>Appannage,</hi> to the second and third Sons, till the Emperor, <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> gave the Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to <hi>Bozon,</hi> Count of <hi>Arles,</hi> to which he joyn'd <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> under Fealty and Homage to the Empire, of which it has always been a Moving Fief since that time.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom of <hi>Arles</hi> subsisted no longer then under four or five Kings; the last of which, nam'd <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> dying without Children, <hi>Conrade,</hi> the <hi>Salick</hi> Emperor, invested <hi>Humbert</hi> of <hi>Morienne,</hi> in the Earldom of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was then Governor of it. <hi>Amedeus,</hi> his Son, succeeded him, and was the Head of the present House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which is much more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Illustrious then <hi>Humberts,</hi> descended from the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> However, <hi>France</hi> pretends that all these Investitures are of no Validity, for that the Empire ought to return by Inheritance to her Kings, after the Death of <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> the last Emperor of the <hi>Carlovingian</hi> Race, from which it had been usurp d by <hi>Conrade</hi> the <hi>Salick;</hi> and by reason of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Claim of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Savoy,</hi> which had been united and annex'd to it long before the Empire was erected, and which by Consequence ought to be consider'd as one of her Proper Demesnes.</p>
                  <p>To these Claims <hi>France</hi> adds a Third, which she derives in Right of <hi>Louise</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Mother of <hi>Francis</hi> I. the Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> VII. Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who marrying <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> covenanted by her Contract of Marriage, That the Children of that Wedlock should succeed, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, to the Whole Dutchy. Now he had two Children, <hi>Philibert</hi> and <hi>Louise,</hi> who pretended to succeed to the Dutchy, after the Death of her Eldest Brother.

However <hi>Francis</hi> I. after some Expostulations with Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> fell into <hi>Savoy</hi> with a Powerful Army, and having reduc'd it in a short time, march'd into <hi>Piemont,</hi> which he subdu'd in like manner, as well as the County of <hi>Nice,</hi> and all in less then one Summer. In short, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly expell'd the Duke out of his Dominions, not leaving him so much as a Foot of Ground, and kept 'em, he and <hi>Henry</hi> II. his Successor, for about Four and Twenty Years, that is to say, till the Peace of <hi>Chasteau de Cambresis,</hi> concluded in the Year 1559. by which King <hi>Henry</hi> relinquish'd to <hi>Spain</hi> above 400 Cities, and 198 Fortresses which had Garrisons in 'em, among which were all those of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> except <hi>Turin, Viniers, Villa Nova, Ast, Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Chevas,</hi> which were afterwards restor'd to the Duke by <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and <hi>Henry</hi> III.

                  <p>'TIs an Old Rubrick of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to pretend a Right to all the Conquests of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> as if the Imperial Crown, and that of <hi>France,</hi> had been one and the same Crown in his time inseparable and never to be divided; but if ever this Pretence were alledg'd to no purpose, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless it is upon this Occasion, where the Dispute is about a Moving Fief, and which by all the most notorious Testimony of History, has all along held of the Empire, and which moreover fell by Succession to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> the <hi>Salick,</hi> so that he had a double Right when he gave the Investiture of this Earldom to <hi>Humbert</hi> of <hi>Morienne.</hi> Moreover the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have been always accounted Feudaries of the Empire, and it is also to the Emperors that they are beholding for the Greatest Lustre of their Dignity. For it was not only the Emperor <hi>Conrade,</hi> who Erected <hi>Savoy</hi> into an Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and gave it to <hi>Humbert;</hi> but it had never been a Dutchy, had it not been for the Good Pleasure of the Emperor <hi>Sigismond,</hi> who did it also at the same time that he was at <hi>Paris.</hi> So far was <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. as Politick and quick-sighted as he was, from pretending to any Sovereignty over it. Assuredly in the Year 1514. the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> took a new Investiture from the Empire, and caus'd the Title of Perpetual Vicar of the Empire to be renew'd to him, which had been granted to his Predecessors in 1336. by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> IV. For tho' at the Sollicitation of <hi>Andrucius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and upon the Importunities of some Princes of the Empire, <hi>Maximilian</hi> revok'd it, 1383. Nevertheless the knowing that was given him, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make it appear that he held of the Empire only, as now he do's;

                  <p>As for the Title of <hi>Francis</hi> I. by his Mother <hi>Louise</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> there is so little Justice in it, that 'tis hardly worth the Taking Notice of it.

                  <p>NOT to perplex our selves with an Impertinent Scrutiny when and how <hi>Lorrain</hi> came first to be annex'd to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> we shall only say, that all Histories testifie that after the Death of <hi>Lewis the Debonaire,</hi> it fell to the share of his Son <hi>Lotharius,</hi> who was Emperor, and who gave it his Name, abrogating the Names of <hi>Austrasia</hi> and <hi>Mets,</hi> by which it was call'd before. But after the Death of <hi>Lothaire</hi> and his three Children, <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> got possession of it by Force of Arms, and kept it till <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> being call'd to the Regency of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> during the Minority of <hi>Charles the Simple,</hi> the General Estates restor'd to him <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in Consequence of which, he caus'd himself to be Crown'd King of it at <hi>Mets,</hi> without the least Scruple. But tho' this Restitution were most just in it self, and so much the more valid and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, because the States of the Kingdom had both unanimously and willingly agreed to it, nevertheless <hi>Lewis d' Outremer,</hi> and <hi>Lothair</hi> his Son, pretended that this was no Legal Alienation, and did their Endeavours to conquer it; but the Emperors <hi>Arnold, Conrade</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> guarded it so well, that the King of <hi>France</hi> could not set his Foot in it. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Otho</hi> had no mind to quarrel with <hi>Lothaire,</hi> he endeavour'd an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the Difference, by giving the Investiture of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Brother, erecting it into a Dutchy holding of the Empire. Which was so far from satisfying <hi>Lothaire,</hi> that it did but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate him the more, and induc'd him to declare War against the New Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> wherein he was several times beaten. This War occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd his Exclusion from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which fell to him by Inheritance after the Death of <hi>Lothaire.</hi> For the French afraid least when he came to be their King, he should recal to mind the Injuries they had done him, and seek his Revenge, declar'd him an Enemy of the State, and for ever uncapable to succeed, both himself and his Off-spring, Electing in his room <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hugh,</hi> Count of <hi>Paris.</hi> From this <hi>Charles</hi> it is that all the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> are descended even to this day; who have all along pay'd Fealty and Homage to the Emperors, as Princes and Guidons of the Empire.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:46341:37"/>
                  <p>Besides this Ancient Title, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> pretend another, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Titular King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Count of <hi>Provence.</hi> For the better understanding of which, we must inform the Reader, That <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> had Two Sons, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Frederick, Charles,</hi> as Eldest, succeeded him to the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and espous'd <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> by whom he had One only Daughter, nam'd <hi>Isabel,</hi> who was marry'd to <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> As for <hi>Frederick,</hi> he marry'd <hi>Margaret de Vaudemont,</hi> by whom he had Male Issue, and among others, <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had also a Son nam'd <hi>René.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Charles, Anthony,</hi> as next Heir Male, seiz'd upon the Dutchy, which <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> disputed with him, who pretended that his Wife was to be preferr'd in the Succession, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Daughter of the deceased Duke; and not being able to agree, there happen'd a long War between 'em: to which, at last, an End was put by the Marriage of <hi>Yoland,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> with <hi>Fery,</hi> Son of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and by the Contract of Marriage it was covenanted, That the Dutchy should be deliver'd into the Hands of <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> during Life; and that after his Death, it should return to <hi>Fery,</hi> and the Heirs of the Body of <hi>Yoland.</hi> However, <hi>René,</hi> without any regard to his Promise, nor the Interests of his Daughter, by his Last Will and Testament, declar'd <hi>Charles du Maine,</hi> his Nephew, to be his Heir, not only to the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but to all the Kingdoms and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to which he had any Right. And in regard that afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> constituted <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. his Heir, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have pretended that by virtue of these two Testaments, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> are devolv'd to their Crown.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this Devolution, <hi>Lorrain</hi> remain'd under the real Dukes of it, till these latter Years; till the King of <hi>France</hi> having met with an Opportunity to improve his dormant Titles, and grounding his Pretence upon the Inconstancy and Levity of the last Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> despoil'd him of his Territories, starting afresh Agreements made with him in the Years 1662. and 1663. By which the Duke made <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. his Heir of the Dutchies of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> upon payment of a Pension of Seven hunder'd thousand Franks during Life, and Two hunder'd thousand Livres more in Rents settl'd upon Land which had the Title of a Dutchy and Peerdom, with a Clause, That all the Princes of the House of <hi>Lorrain</hi> should, for the time to come, be acknowledg'd Princes of the Blood of <hi>France,</hi> and capable of succeeding, for want of nearer Male Heirs.</p>

                  <p>'TIS never without an extreme Reluctancy that we mention these far fetch'd, leud, superannuated Titles wherewith <hi>France</hi> provides her self; but we are forc'd to do it, because she her self puts such a Value upon 'em. But among all those which she produces, and which signifie nothing, this is one of the slightest. <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Emperor had <hi>Lorrain</hi> in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of his Dividend; afterwards it fell to his Successors, and was not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46341:38"/> united to <hi>France,</hi> but by the Usurpation of <hi>Charles the Bald:</hi> which was so clearly acknowledg'd by the States of the Kingdom, that they thought it their Duty to restore it to <hi>Charles the Gross,</hi> as an Inheritance that belong'd to him. Now what lawful Title can the King of <hi>France</hi> deduce from all this? Is Usurpation then a good Title, and Restitution of an ill got Estate a bad Title? For this is that which must be granted to authorize his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions. It would be more reasonable to say, That the Crown of <hi>France</hi> belongs of Right to the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> lawful Successors descending from <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the First Duke, who was unjustly excluded from the Crown by the States of the Kingdom, to advance in his room one <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> the Founder of the present Race. However, in regard that long Possession authorizes 'em, and that far from exciting the Princes to a new War, we could heartily wish that it were in our Power to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute toward a happy Conclusion of this which torments all <hi>Europe,</hi> we shall not examin whether that Exclusion were of any force or no?</p>
                  <p>The Title which the King of <hi>France</hi> derives from <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> is no better then the t'other. For who ever heard talk of acquiring Crowns in right of two or three unjust Testators, who bequeath'd 'em to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the lawful Possessors. For in short, the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being acknowledg'd to be a Fief of the Empire, was consequently Male, and ought to have return'd to <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Son of <hi>Frederick.</hi> This is a thing not to be scrupl'd in the least. But suppose that <hi>Lorrain</hi> were a Female Fief, and that <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> were the lawful Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of it, to the Exclusion of <hi>Frederick</hi> and his Heirs, in Right of his Wife <hi>Isabel,</hi> it naturally follows, that after the Death of his Wife <hi>Isabel,</hi> the Dutchy belong'd to <hi>Yoland</hi> his Daughter, marry'd to <hi>Fery</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and to her Successors; and that all the Last Wills and Testaments made to the contrary, were injurious and unjust, since they depriv'd the Lawful Heirs of the Diadem, to bequeath it to Strangers.</p>
                  <p>As to the last of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Pretensions, which are grounded upon the Treaties concluded with the deceas'd Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in 1662, and 1663. it may be said, That they are still less to be justify'd.

They still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Old Assertion, That the Empire was united inseparably to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in the Person of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and that therefore by consequence they have a Right of Sovereignty over all that holds of the Empire.

                  <p>'TIS needless here to set forth, how the City of <hi>Avignon</hi> depended at the Beginning upon the Kingdom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and afterwards upon the Earldom of <hi>Provence;</hi> 'tis sufficient that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd the one by virtue of the other, upon the same Title they pretend at this day to the Sovereignty over it, at least.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joan</hi> III.

This Battel was fought in the Year 1206. After which, the Count of <hi>Montfort</hi> being Master of the Country, committed most horrid Murthers and Massacres of those poor People who were so stedfast in their Religion, that without any hesitation, they flung themselves into the middle of the Flames with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46341:39"/> their Children in their Arms, rather then renounce their Faith; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less all these Cruelties which they made use of against 'em, were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient utterly to exterminate 'em; only they did not appear so numerous as before, till the Year 1534. at what time <hi>Calvin</hi> openly Preach'd those Doctrines which the Reformed averr to be the same with those which the <hi>Albigeois</hi> profess'd. But to return to our Subject: The Pope believing that after those People were absolutely reduc'd, their Country belong'd to Him, erected it into a Kingdom, and invested the Count <hi>de Monfort</hi> in it, under the Title of <hi>King of Occitania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> as in Justice he might doe, oppos'd it, alledging that <hi>Gasconie</hi> and <hi>Languedoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d, and had embrac'd Erroneous Opinions in despite of his Commands, that was no sufficient Reason why he should lose his Provinces, anciently and lawfully annex'd to his Crown. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, because he was well enough acquainted with the Spirit of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for that he fear'd the Consequences of that Election, he wheedl'd off the Count of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> and to make him amends, advanc'd him to be Constable of <hi>France,</hi> and gave him the Governments of <hi>Poitou</hi> and <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain;</hi> and as for the Pope, he pacify'd him likewise, by giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to him anew, the City of <hi>Avignon,</hi> together with the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was possess'd by the Holy See already. Whether the King of <hi>France</hi> did well and Politickly in granting so many Honours and Estates to the Count of <hi>Montfort,</hi> upon whom he ought to have look'd as his Enemy, or at least as a Person very much to be suspected, we shall not go about to determine: for the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was very Potent at that time. She excommunicated and depos'd Kings for a Trifle; nor was there any Violence or Cruelty which she did not commit under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is the Nature of that Court, which will never alter: for tho' she be much fallen from that high degree of Grandeur and Puissance, yet her Genius and her Inclinations are still apparently to be discover'd by the Dreadful Jurisdiction which she Exercises in her Tribunals of the Inquisition. The way which she took to make her self Mistress of the County of <hi>Venessin,</hi> is another Proof of the same Assertion. For the Count of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> who was Lord of it, being inform'd by the Complaints of a poor Widow, that the Curate refus'd to bury the Body of her Husband, because she had not ready Money to pay him upon the Nail, was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at such a piece of Inhumanity, that to make him an Example, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a deep Hole to be made in the Ground, and that the Curate should be buried alive, together with the dead Corps, which already began to be very noisome. The Pope, who at that time lay at <hi>Avignon,</hi> order'd the Count to be seiz'd, Excommunicated him, and shut him up in a dark and close Dungeon, where he made him doe Penance for several Years <hi>in pane Doloris, &amp; aqua Augustiae.</hi> After which, he let him out to undergo the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> his Shirt hanging out, his Hands ty'd behind him, and bare Foot; thus he caus'd him to be lead through the Streets in Procession, and Whipp'd as he pass'd along: and all this done, he forc'd him to renounce his Right to all his Lands and Lordships, and then sent him to Prison again, there to end his miserable days, which were not many: for being
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46341:40"/> expos'd of a sudden to the Light, after a Tedious Imprisonment as it were in utter Darkness, besides the Severity of his Whipping, all this together with the Ignominy he had undergone, his Grief and Despair of ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his Liberty wrought such an Effect upon him, that he dy'd in Twelve Days after; leaving to his Posterity a famous Example of the Barbarity of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Acquisition, as you see, was not only Unjust, but Tyrannical and Criminal; nevertheless because that by the Treaty of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Holy See has been acknowledg'd Lawful Proprietor of <hi>Venessin,</hi> as well as of <hi>Avignon,</hi> we will not contest it with her, notwithstanding the usual Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the French, That Lands united o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>AFter the Fall of the Roman Empire, the <hi>Lombards</hi> made themselves Masters of <hi>Italy,</hi> and settl'd a Kingdom in it, which lasted about Two Hunder'd Years, during which time they so terribly oppress'd the Popes, and held 'em in so great Subjection, that they were oblig'd to have frequent Recourse to the Protection of the Constantinopolitan Emperors, or the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Among the rest, Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> call'd in King <hi>Pepin</hi> to his aid, about the Year 768. against <hi>Rachisus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuti,</hi> who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Luitprand,</hi> And History reports, that <hi>Pepin,</hi> after he had pass'd the Mountains, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was Crown'd King of <hi>France;</hi> after which, he march'd against <hi>Rachisus,</hi> and being just ready to join Battel, he made a Solemn Vow, and also caus'd Letters Patterns to be drawn up in due Form, to give the Exarchat of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which contain'd Sixteen Cities, and the Country of <hi>Pentapolis</hi> that comprehended Thirteen, to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> In performance of which, after the Defeat of <hi>Rachisus,</hi> he himself lay'd the Keys of all those Cities upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Altar, by that same Act to render his Donation so much the more Authentick; reserving to himself of the whole Country nothing but the Sovereignty only. However, some time after, <hi>Didier,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Rachisus,</hi> having once more despoyl'd the Pope, <hi>Charlemain</hi> came as his Father, into <hi>Italy,</hi> of which he made himself sole Master, after the Defeat of <hi>Didier</hi> at the famous Battel of <hi>Verseil,</hi> where he was taken Prisoner and sent into <hi>France.</hi> After this, <hi>Charlemain</hi> march'd directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was Crown'd Emperor, and confirm'd to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Donation which <hi>Pepin</hi> had made to his Predecessor of the Exarchie and the Country of <hi>Pentapolis.</hi> And upon these two Donations it is, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ground their Pretensions to the Ecclesiastical Estate; for which they have several times demanded Fealty and Homage of the Popes, who as they say, were net invested but upon that Condition.</p>

                  <p>THere are many Kinds of Donations; but not to lose Time in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding 'em one after the other, we shall only say, that they may be generally reduc'd to two sorts. The one is without any Reserve or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction; so that he who gives, has no longer any Right or Claim to any Acknowledgment, or otherwise for the Thing given, which becomes from that very moment the Propriety of him who receives and accepts it. These kinds of Donations were formerly forbid among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and some other People who look'd upon 'em as unjust; but they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards authoriz'd by the Law of the Twelve Tables; and more particularly by the Law of Christianity, which recommends to all the World the Act of Giving, without any Expectation of Recompence, but that of Well-Doing, according to the Precept of the Gospel, <hi>that it is better to Give then to Receive,</hi> more-especially to those who are in want. The Second sort of Donation properly concerns the Ufufructuary Enjoyment and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit only of the thing given; so that He who receives it, is after that bound to Acknowledgment and Fealty to his Benefactor. All Fiefs <hi>in Capite</hi> held of the Crown, are of this Nature. Now the Question is, whether the Donations of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemain</hi> are of this Second Nature. For in this case there is no contending with <hi>France</hi> for the Right of Sovereignty over the <hi>Exarchat</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis.</hi> But in regard the Originals of these Ancient Acts are lost, we are oblig'd to refer our selves to History, which asserts nothing Positive as to this Matter of Fact. It only tells us, that after those Donations, the Popes had so great a Respect for the Emperors and Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> being cited before <hi>Lewis the Debonaire,</hi> he made no Scruple to appear in order to the justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself. <hi>Sigonius</hi> also reports and assures us, That he had seen seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of Submission made by the Successors of <hi>Adrian</hi> to the same <hi>Louis the Debonaire,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Bald;</hi> which never could have been, had they not been look'd upon as Vassals to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> for the Countries given 'em by King <hi>Pepin.</hi> 'Tis true, that we might alledge what has been said before of other Investitures granted by <hi>Charlemain,</hi> that he Conferr'd 'em only as Emperor, and so, that the Ecclesiastical Estate ought to hold of the Empire, and not of <hi>France.</hi> But in regard we find that <hi>Pepin</hi> had made the Donation before <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and that the Latter did but confirm the Donation of the Former, that Reason would not be of any force. The only Reason therefore that can be alledg'd against the Pretensions of <hi>France</hi> in this case is, that they are absolutely prescrib'd and lost by vertue of a Possession of several Ages; besides, that it is of as great Importance for the Good and Repose of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Pope should not be subject to any Prince, as it is of highest Moment that he should not usurp any Right or Authority over the Temporalities of Princes. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the Monarch of whom he held, whether Emperor or King of <hi>France,</hi> who are already but too potent, would then become more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46341:41"/> powerful still, by means of the Spiritual Power which they would then have at Command as well as their own Temporal. So that 'tis the Interest of the Christian Princes, not to suffer any Changes in that particular.</p>

                  <p>THe Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has reason sufficient to dispute the Adoption of <hi>Lewis. Joan</hi> was a Woman of a lewd Life, who had not power to dispose of her Estates; and so much the less, because that what she did was only out of Revenge against the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> her really adopted Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he thwarted her in her Extravagancies, and condemn'd the Infamous Life she led with <hi>Caraccio,</hi> as we have already set forth. So that altho' the way which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> took to make himself Master of <hi>Nice,</hi> should be look'd upon as a Piece of Usurpation, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had reason only to have complain'd of it, and not the King of <hi>France,</hi> who himself held <hi>Provence</hi> but by a false Title, as we shall make out in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it self. However, to justifie the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in reference to the King of <hi>France,</hi> we must needs say, that setting aside the dubious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs after the Death of Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> who left behind her Titles very disputable to several Pretenders, at what time the Inhabitants of <hi>Nice</hi> might with justice enough, make use of the Opportunity to regain their Liberty, or else to surrender themselves into the Power of some other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46341:41"/> Sovereign, better able and nearer at Hand to protect 'em, I say, we must needs averr, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has acquir'd a Title that the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot dispute against him, by the Treaty which <hi>Amedeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made with <hi>Yoland,</hi> Mother and Governess of <hi>Lewis</hi> III. by which <hi>Yoland</hi> acknowledging that <hi>Lewis</hi> her Son was indebted to the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in the Summ of a Hunder'd and Sixty Thousand Livres, which he was no way in a Condition to repay, she did therefore relinquish, convey, and make over to him the Sovereignty and Propriety of the County of <hi>Nice,</hi> with all its Dependencies; and in regard this Resignation was renew'd by the Peace of <hi>Cambrai,</hi> and two other Treaties that follow it, and after that, also, by <hi>Hen.</hi> III. in his Passage through <hi>Piemont,</hi> when he return'd from <hi>Poland,</hi> 'tis Evident that the King of <hi>France</hi> has no Title to this County.</p>

The King of <hi>France</hi> had taken care from the Beginning to make himself Master of it, under pretence of keeping it till the Difference between the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and his Uncle <hi>Adolphus,</hi> was decided. For the first pretended to it as Heir to the King his Father, and the latter as nearest of Kin to the last Duke, and consequently Presumptive Heir. The King of <hi>France,</hi> who would have been glad to have had the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for his Feudatary, made him an Offer of the Dutchy, provided he would doe him Homage. But that Prince who has a Courage too haughty to stoop, and who began to disgust the Proceedings of <hi>France,</hi> positively declar'd, That he would never accept the Investiture of that Dutchy but from the Emperor, of whom the Dutchy really and truly held. So that the King of <hi>France</hi> being nettl'd with that Answer, gave it the Prince of <hi>Birkenfield,</hi> who having no Title to it, accepted it with Joy upon any Condition they were pleas'd to impose upon him.</p>
                  <p>As for the City of <hi>Casal,</hi> in regard it was absolutely necessary for the King of <hi>France</hi> to be Master of it, to the end he might have a Door open into <hi>Italy</hi> whenever he desir'd it, there was nothing which he more eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd, and he sollicited the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> a long time to sell it into his Hands, or Exchange it for some Equivalent in the Heart of his Kingdom. But the Duke withstood his Temptations all along; for he well knew 'twas the way for him to incurr the displeasure of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of all the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> But at length, want of Money forc'd him to truckle,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46341:42"/> which the King of <hi>France</hi> gave him, and then he admitted a French Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison into the Citadel, about Ten Years ago. Since which time, the French have held it; and because they have disburs'd a Summ of Money, they imagine they have a Right to it beyond all Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Casal</hi> were necessary for the King of <hi>France</hi> on <hi>Italy</hi> side, he had no less occasion for <hi>Strasburg</hi> on that side next to <hi>Germany.</hi> 'Tis a City that might easily have been made very strong, as since we have seen; and which moreover, being both large and wealthy, was able plentifully to supply the Necessities of the Army. In a word, it lay convenient for the King of <hi>France,</hi> and this Title, which his Council look'd upon as sufficient and lawful enough, produc'd another, which at least might serve for a good Pretension, and that was the new Title of Dependency. 'Twas therefore given out, that this was the Capital City of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been relinquish'd to him by the Treaty of <hi>Munster,</hi> ought of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to belong to him: and upon this Foundation he besieg'd it in the midst of a secure Peace, and by means of a Correspondence which he held with certain treacherous Burgomasters, it was taken in three Weeks. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror who could not chuse but be extreamly troubl'd at this Invasion, set forth his Reasons to the King of <hi>France</hi> by his Embassador. But his Answer was, That he very much wonder'd, that the Emperor should take it amiss that he employ'd his Arms in the reducing a Rebellious City, that for a long time had incurr'd his Indignation. And in regard he was already in Possession, and consequently in a Condition to justifie his frivolous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and for that the Emperor had to deal with the <hi>Turk</hi> at the same time, there was no other way but patiently to swallow the Bitter Morsel.</p>

                  <p>THe Usurpation of the Dutchy of <hi>Deux Ponts</hi> is so manifest, that it would be loss of Time and Words to go about to prove it. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Duke his Uncle, are in dispute about the Succession to the deceased Duke of <hi>Deux Ponts;</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> seizes upon it under colour of Keeping it till the Difference be decided, to whom it belongs. Afterwards when they are agreed, he sets afoot certain Titles that were never so much as heard of before, and gives 'em to understand, that they had been all the while contending for the Bishops Rochet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb, and striving for that which was none of their own: then which there could be nothing more Unjust. Methinks I hear this Doctor of the Civil Law cry to the two Pleaders in the Select Fables, <hi>'Twas a good Oyster, Gentlemen; go and live in Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a little more appearance of Equity in the taking of <hi>Casal:</hi> for when a Man purchases a thing and pays for it, 'tis naturally a good Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But after all, was it in the Power of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to sell it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46341:42"/> without the Emperor's Consent? For <hi>Casal</hi> is a Fief of the Empire, and by the Golden Bull, it could not change its Master, but by vertue of an Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the New Possessor is bound to obtain of the Emperor, but which the King of <hi>France</hi> was so far from demanding, that he declar'd, He thought himself too Great a Lord to hold of any one whatever, and that he knew well enough how to put himself into Possession without the help of any other Person. This is that which is call'd, <hi>pulling off the Mask,</hi> and he that will not confess it, must be wilfully Blind: especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering after what manner he made himself Master of the City, which by the Covenants, was to have remain'd in the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> the Citadel only having been sold to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Case of the City of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> is very near the same; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the French alledge, the Unjustice of their Proceedings is apparently to be discover'd. The City of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> (say they) is an Ancient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> which could not be dismember'd but by a bad Title; and which by the Right of Re-union, ought to return to the Whole, from whence it was separated. Which if it were so, how comes it to pass, that all the Cities of <hi>Europe</hi> have acknowledg'd it for a free City for above these Two Hunder'd Years? And wherefore had the King of <hi>France</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters always residing there, till it was reduc'd? And why was he wont to Treat with her, which he was frequently wont to do, as with a State which had no Dependence in the World upon him? This Speaks it self; there needs no Commentary: wherefore we shall conclude this Chapter, and at the same time all that, we have to say to the Pretensions of the King of <hi>France,</hi> with a Verse of M. <hi>de la Fontaine</hi> Extreamly Suitable to his Conduct, <hi>The Reason of the Strongest always is the Best.</hi>

                  <p>BY the Partition of his Empire which <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> made to his Children, the West fell to the two Younger Sons, under the Title of the <hi>Western Empire;</hi> which subsisted in the Persons of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors till <hi>Augustulus,</hi> who lost it in the Fifth Age, to the <hi>Goths, Vandals</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> who sackt and ruin'd every Corner of it, insomuch that it was absolutely dismember'd; which occasion'd the Rise of so many Petty States. For every Prince and every Government seizing upon a Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this prodigious Wreck, some parcell'd out for themselves an Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, others a Dutchy: Some Cities also, taking their Advantage of the Revolution, regain'd their Liberty, and set up Republicks. But at length, after an Interval of about Three hundred Years, the Western Empire came
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46341:43"/> to be establish'd in the Person of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> who re-united under his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dominion, <hi>Germany, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he expell'd the Moors. In the Year 800. he was Crown'd Emperor by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> to whom he gave the Exarchat of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> or rather, confirm'd the former Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pepin</hi> his Father. And two Years after, the Partition of the Two Empires was adjusted with <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> Emperor of the East; and the River <hi>Loranto,</hi> or <hi>Castiliano,</hi> was agreed to be the Bounds of Both Empires in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that in this Third Re-establishment, or Foundation of the Third Empire, it was Hereditary; for that all Histories testifie, That <hi>Lewis the Debonaire</hi> succeeded <hi>Charlemain, Lothaire Lewis,</hi> and so the rest, without the least Scruple or Contradiction, for a Hunder'd Years and more together, while the <hi>Carlovingian</hi> Race reign'd in <hi>Germany;</hi> till being Extinct by the Death of <hi>Charles the Gross, Conrade</hi> Duke of <hi>Franconia</hi> was Elected Emperor by the Princes, Ecclesiastical Lords, and the Deputies of the Cities representing the People. The Cities also, and Lords of <hi>Italy,</hi> had a Determinative Voice at those Elections, as it is apparent by the Elections of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Lothaire</hi> II. and <hi>Conrade</hi> III. But after <hi>Frederick</hi> I. the Germans appropriated to themselves alone the Right of Electing the Emperors; and in process of time, it was contracted into the Hands of Seven great Officers of the Empire, which at this day are call'd Electors. It would be a difficult thing to affirm positively, when or how this was done: for if we may believe Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> it was Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. who instituted the Seven Electors in the First Council of <hi>Lion,</hi> in the Year 1245. But if we will referr our selves to <hi>Thuanus</hi> and <hi>Textor,</hi> it was the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> III. who created 'em, in the Year 1001. Or if we will follow the Opinion of the Abbot of <hi>Ʋspergh,</hi> this Constitution was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the Reign of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. in an Assembly of the Princes. However it were, it is acknowledg'd by all the World, that <hi>Charles</hi> IV. confirm'd this Custom of Electors by a famous Decree call'd the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> by reason of the Seal of Gold that is affix'd to it. It was made, read, and publish'd in the Diet held at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1356. and contains all the Regulations requisite for the Form and Ceremonies of Elections, and whatever concerns the Government of the Empire; which hitherto has been rigorously observ'd, without the least Innovation, only that the Number of Electors, which was no more then Seven at first, that is to say, Three Ecclesiastical, the Archbishops of <hi>Mayence, Treves,</hi> and <hi>Cologne;</hi> and Four Secular, the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> of latter Times there have been added Two more, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Hanover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may return to the Emperor's Pretensions to <hi>France,</hi> we must say, That they are grounded upon the Partition made among the Children of <hi>Lewis the Debonaire.</hi> This Partition was regulated and order'd in his Life-time. However, after his Death, the Sons not satisfy'd with their Allotments, would needs try the Fortune of their Arms; insomuch that they wag'd War one against the other, with extraordinary Heat and Fury, till the terrible Battel of <hi>Fontenay</hi> being fought, wherein there perish'd above a Hunder'd thousand Men, the Three Princes found their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46341:44"/> Forces equally exhausted, and desiring nothing more then an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by common Consent referr'd their Interests to the Pope, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Partition which <hi>Lewis the Debonaire</hi> their Father had made; by which the Empire, with all the Territories on the other side of the <hi>Meuse</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> as far as the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where now lie the Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countries, Liege, Treves, Juliers, Luxemburgh,</hi> together with all the Country beyond the <hi>Saone,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where now lie <hi>Franche Conté,</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Dauphinate, Provence;</hi> and in short, all <hi>Italy</hi> fell to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaire,</hi> who was the Eldest: <hi>Lewis</hi> II. had <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary:</hi> and <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> the Youngest of the Three, had <hi>France</hi> for his share, upon Condition, however, To hold of the Emperor <hi>Lothaire</hi> by Fealty and Homage as well as his Brother <hi>Lewis:</hi> and in case they happen'd to die without Issue, that their Dominions should be united to the Emperor: which happen'd in the Person of <hi>Lewis,</hi> sirnam'd the <hi>Germanic.</hi> Upon this Homage, agreed by <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> to his Brother, it is, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ground their Pretensions to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>WE have already set forth the Pretensions of <hi>France</hi> to the Empire; now you have heard the Pretensions of the Empire to <hi>France.</hi> The business is, how to reconcile such different Interests as these of which we have already spoken, and those of which we are now to discourse. Without doubt, it would prove a Matter of great Difficulty; so that we shall not undertake to prescribe the Means. We only set down Things as they are; and we set forth, in our <hi>Enquiries,</hi> one part of the Reasons <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> without pretending to captivate the Sentiments of the Reader, who may dispose of his Judgment as he pleases, which is a Right of his, that in Justice ought not to be anticipated. According to this Maxim then, we must assert, with the same Sincerity which we profess, That the Claims of the Empire, though they are of a fresher Date then those of <hi>France,</hi> yet are they not sufficient to authorize a just Molestation of the Most Christian Kings. We know likewise very well, that it is not above Two hunder'd Years ago, that an Emperor came into <hi>France,</hi> and that he was receiv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Ceremonies that were anciently observ'd at <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Entries of the Emperors; for he was preceded, though at high Noon, with Two hunder'd Flambeaux of Virgins Wax; the Peers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were present, and all the Courts of Justice went to Harangue him. In the same Capital City also he exercis'd all the most Essential and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Acts of Sovereignty: for he took his Seat in the Parlament, created Knights, and declar'd Count <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince of the Empire. To this may be added, That in the Impartial Reign of the <hi>Carlovingian</hi> Race, <hi>France</hi> held of the Empire; and that after the Death of <hi>Charles the Gross, Conrade</hi> caus'd <hi>Charles the Simple</hi> to acknowledge Fealty, and do him Homage. And lastly, That <hi>Charles</hi> VII. made no scruple to accept of the Title of <hi>Vicar of the Sacred Empire,</hi> which render'd him Inferior to the Emperor. But after all, these Reasons that were good
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46341:44"/> at that time, cease to be so now. If they would have preserv'd 'em, they ought to have kept 'em up, and renew'd 'em, from time to time, by Acts of Sovereignty, by Demands and Protestations, and not to have suffer'd 'em to lie dormant for above Two Ages: Prescription being sufficient to abrogate Claims and Titles, in their Original the best that ever were in the World.</p>

                     </gap>or to the City of <hi>Metz, Toul, Verdun;</hi> and the Just Interests those Cities have in their own Liberty.</head>
                  <p>THe Pretensions of the Emperor to these Three Cities, extend no further then only to the Sovereignty, and consequently are well grounded; because 'tis well known that they have all along been Fiefs immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Imperial Crown, as well as that of <hi>Liege,</hi> which is at this day a Member of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that in the Year 1090. when <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was preparing for his Expedition to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> these Four Cities, which were his own by Right of Property, redeem'd themselves out of his Hands. <hi>Metz</hi> gave him a Hunder'd thousand Crowns, <hi>Liege</hi> a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and fifty thousand, <hi>Toul</hi> Fifty thousand, and <hi>Verdun</hi> Thirty thousand. But besides that this Sale, by virtue of which they became Republicks, was so far from giving any Right to <hi>France,</hi> that it displays the Injustice of her Possession, it may be added, That <hi>Godfrey</hi> had no Right to sell, nor did he really sell any more then his own Property, without any Prejudice to the Sovereign Rights of the Imperial Crown. However it were, 'tis certain, that from that time, till the Year 1551, they continu'd Free and Imperial Cities, such as at this day are <hi>Ʋlm, Frankfort,</hi> and <hi>Norimberg,</hi> excepting the Authority of the Bishops in those Places, which was much like that which the Bishops of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> enjoy in their Cities.</p>
                  <p>This continu'd (as we have said) till the Year 1551. at what time they fell under the Obedience of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> For the Emperor, <hi>Charles</hi> V. at that time most violently persecuted the Protestants of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> who thereupon call'd to their Assistance <hi>Henry</hi> II. as being the greatest Enemy <hi>Charles</hi> had, and the most able to defend 'em. <hi>Henry</hi> sent the Constable <hi>Montmorency</hi> with a powerful Army, who would needs pass thorough <hi>Metz.</hi> Presently the Citizens, not dreaming of any Harm, open'd their Gates, and let him in; and not only himself, but as many of the Soldiers as thought fit to enter. A Fault so much the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, for that a Petty State ought always to be continually mistrustful of her Protectors, who generally seek Occasions only to make themselves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Masters of those that have recourse to 'em for Aid. This Truth, which all past Ages, and a thousand Experiences have render'd Famous, was either unknown to Them, or else they thought it not convenient to be so Prudent. They thought the King of <hi>France</hi> would have been so generous, as to grant 'em his Assistance <hi>gratis,</hi> and without any other
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46341:45"/> Design but that of humbling <hi>Charles</hi> V. his Enemy: so that the Constable accomplish'd his Design with all the Easiness he could desire. He enter'd the City, and after he had got into it as many Officers and Soldiers as he thought convenient, he feign'd himself sick, and sent for the Mayor and Sheriffs, telling 'em, That he desir'd 'em to be Witnesses to his Last Will and Testament, besides several other things of Importance which he had to reveal to 'em. But when they were met together in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he started up of a sudden, and stabb'd the Mayor with his Dagger to the Heart. The Signal being thus given, the Officers did the same to the Sheriffs; and then crying, <hi>The Town's our own,</hi> drew their Soldiers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a moment, seiz'd upon all the most considerable Places and Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, especially the two Gates at which they enter'd; so that neither the Burgesses, nor the small Garrison they had, were in a Condition to make any Resistance. <hi>Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun</hi> follow'd the Fate of <hi>Metz,</hi> the last of which Cities the King of <hi>France</hi> gave to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after this, the Protestants of <hi>Germany</hi> would never confide in him more, but forsook both him and his Assistance altogether. So that <hi>Charles</hi> V. accomplish'd his Designs with Ease; and having defeated 'em, depos'd the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and invested his Youngest Son in the Electoral Dignity. After which, pufft up with his Victory, he fate down before <hi>Metz</hi> with a powerful Army, and Six and forty Pieces of Cannon; but through the vigorous Resistance of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who Commanded in the Town, he was constrain'd to raise his Siege with considerable Loss. Since which time, these Cities have never been separated from the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <head>Enquiries into the Pretensions of the Emperor to the Three Cities of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THe bare Rehersal after what manner the King of <hi>France</hi> made himself Master of these Three Cities, is sufficient to make it evidently appear, that he holds 'em by no Just Title. 'Tis true, That from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> II. till the End of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. they kept 'em only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Colour of Protection; and all Litigious Controversies were remov'd to the Imperial Chamber of <hi>Spire.</hi> But about the Year 1633. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. believing that a Possession of about Seventy or Eighty Years, was enough to make him a just Proprietor, declar'd himself Sovereign Lord of 'em, and settl'd a Parlament there, to which he subjected all the Country. His Reasons were, because that <hi>Henry</hi> II. had seiz'd upon 'em as an Imperial Estate, being at War with the Emperor; since which time, the Restitution of 'em had not been stipulated in any Treaty. That the Rights of the Empire were so far vanish'd and lost on this side the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as if the Lands lay open to the <hi>First Occupant:</hi> thus Originally <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> held of the Empire though now they were acknowledg'd to be Sovereign States. To all this he added the Consent of the People, who had willingly exchang'd his Protoction into Subjection to his Government. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, 'tis evident, that these Cities were usurp'd by manifest
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46341:45"/> Violence and Treachery; and though the Consent of the People be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, they underwent this Alteration of their Condition as an Oppression: and we doubt not, but that inur'd as they are to French Dominion, they would be cordially glad of their former Liberty, might they have it restor'd 'em. However, were it not, but that on the contrary, the Citizens of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> should protest a hunder'd times, that they desir'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>French,</hi> what is to be thence inferr'd against the Emperor? His Rights of Sovereignty remain entire, and the King of <hi>France</hi> is bound to swear Fealty, and do him Homage for the said Cities. This admits of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>

                  <p>NEither do these, any more then the former, extend any further then the Sovereignty. For which reason, without looking back to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between the Children of <hi>Lewis the Debonaire,</hi> by which you will find that those Provinces fell to <hi>Lothaire,</hi> we must say, That since that time, they were a Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which held of the Empire; and that after the Death of the last King, being re-annex'd to the Body of the Empire, they were again alienated under the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Liege</hi> Fief, and Homages by <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, who erected the Earldom of <hi>Arles</hi> into a Kingdom, in favour of Count <hi>Bozon;</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd upon this Occasion. The Empress was accus'd of Adultery by the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Mansfeild. Bozon,</hi> who thought he knew her to be a Vertuous Lady, could not brook so great a Calumny, and therefore resolv'd to defend her by Force of Arms, according to the Customs of those Times. Thereupon he went to the Emperor's Court, but <hi>incognito,</hi> and arm'd at all Points presented himself on Horse-back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate of the Palace, and there fix'd up a Challenge against those that accus'd the Empress of Unchastity, either to make good their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or fight him. Immediately the Emperor sent for the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Mansfeild,</hi> and order'd 'em to undertake the Combat: but they were both vanquish'd; and <hi>Boson</hi> having laid 'em sprawling upon the Ground, constrain'd 'em to confess the Truth. A Third also, who would maintain the two former to be Persons of Honour, had the same Destiny. Which done, <hi>Boson,</hi> thus Victorious, retreated, without so much as lifting up the Vizor of his Helmet, and return'd Home. But the Emperor, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to know him, caus'd him to be follow'd; and understanding who he was, sent Embassadors to him, on purpose to return him Thanks, and gave him a Part of the Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with the Title of <hi>King of Arles;</hi> of which he was King, both He and his Successors, for Four Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, till the Race failing, the Kingdom return'd to the Empire, by Right of Reversion and Succession; the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> II. who reign'd at that time, being Brother-in-Law to <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the last King, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd him his Kingdom upon his Death-bed. By which means, the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46341:46"/> Empire acquir'd a Title to that Country; or rather corroborated the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for all the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> of the Second Race, or of the Third Race after them, never pretended to it. After the Death of <hi>Rodolphus</hi> it was, that the Archbishop of <hi>Treves</hi> took upon him the Title of Chancellor of the Empire <hi>per Regum Aretense.</hi> At length in Process of time there were four particular Lordships or Signories erected in the Kingdom; that is to say▪ the Earldoms of <hi>Provence,</hi> the Dauphiny of <hi>Viennois,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Morienne,</hi> afterwards Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Counts of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> all holding of the Empire, as the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> do at this day. As for <hi>Provence,</hi> it came to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in 1482. by the last Will and Testament of <hi>Charles du Maine</hi> in favour of <hi>Lewis</hi> II. And the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate was given to <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> by <hi>Imbert Dauphin</hi> in 1343. upon Condition, that from thenceforward the First Son of <hi>France,</hi> and Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heir of the Crown, should take upon him the Title of Dauphin, and bear his Arms quarter'd with that of the <hi>Dauphinate.</hi>

                  <p>'TIS an Axiom in Law not to be contradicted, That no Possession can be enjoy'd by a Better and Freer Title then that of Acquisition, unless there be a Franchisement by latter Agreements. If <hi>France</hi> had made any such Agreement with the Empire, there is some Probability of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for her Pretensions; tho' in truth it be not in the Power of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to alienate the Fiefs of the Empire, of which he is only the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Usufructuary. But never was any Grant of that Nature made by the Emperors; so far from it, that they have always protested against it. <hi>Charles</hi> the First-also, enter'd <hi>Provence</hi> with an Army in the Year 1536. with a design to re-conquer those three Countries, or at least to enforce King <hi>Francis</hi> I. to do him Homage.

                  <p>BEfore we come to the Particular Concerns of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> it will not be amiss to give some short Account of the Original of it, and of the means by which it arriv'd at so High a Pinacle of Grandeur wherein it was in the Time of <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
                  <p>The Generality of Historians are not agreed in their Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> no more then in a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Revolutions as Memorable as that. But according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>Trithemius, Larius, Piesdorpuis, Munster, Thieri, Fierdorpius,</hi> and some others, it descends from the House of <hi>France,</hi> and takes its Rise from <hi>Sigebert,</hi> the Son of <hi>Theodebert,</hi> who at that time contending with his Brother <hi>Thieri</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Metz,</hi> was murder'd by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Brunehault,</hi> who not content to have embru'd her Hands in the Blood of her Son, persecuted her Children also, one of which she murder'd and caus'd the other to flye the Kingdom, and to seek to the Emperor <hi>Lothaire</hi> his Kinsman for shelter. This was that same <hi>Sigebert</hi> who built the Castle of <hi>Habspurg,</hi> which the Emperor for his sake erected into an Earldom, and from whom descended all the Earls of that Name, till <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who was elected Emperor in 1275. and who invested his Son <hi>Albert</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> from whence he took the Title, which his Successors have continu'd ever since. This Emperor was Emperor after his Father; but when he dy'd, the Empire devolv'd into another Family: Nor did it return to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> till the Year 1438. under <hi>Albert</hi> the II. and since that to this very Day, it has all along continu'd in it. Upon the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> V. this House was divided into two Branches: To his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> he left the Empire; and to <hi>Philip</hi> II. his Son, he gave <hi>Spain</hi> with all the Dependencies belonging to it. That Great Monarchy fell to his House by the Means of two Marriages. The first, was that of <hi>Maximilian, Charles</hi> the Fifth's Grandfather, with <hi>Maria,</hi> the Heiress of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who brought him for her Dowry the Earldom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Four Dutchies of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> viz. <hi>Brabant, Luxemburgh, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>Guelders,</hi> and the Earldoms of <hi>Hainault, Namur, Holland Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, Malines, East Frise, Over Yssel</hi> and <hi>Groninghen.</hi> The Second, which was between the Arch-Duke, <hi>Philip,</hi> the Son of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Joan,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and Heiress of Both <hi>Spains;</hi> that is to say, by her Father's side of <hi>Arragon, Catalogna, Roussillon, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia, Majorca, Minorca, Ivaca, Fromentire, Sardigna, Sicily, Naples, Grenada</hi> and <hi>Navarr;</hi> and by the Mother's side, of the two <hi>Castilles, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, Leon, Asturia, Biscaye, Murcia, Cardova, Andalousia</hi> and <hi>Estre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madura.</hi> To the Imperial Branch fell the Empire, with the Ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of <hi>Austria,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> acquir'd by the Marriage of <hi>Ann,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> the last King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> And thus, in few Words, it was that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> rais'd it self, and obtain'd those Titles, by virtue of which it En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys so many Kingdoms and Provinces, which no Body can dispute with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46341:47"/> the Imperial Family, without manifesting at the same time a Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit of Contention, and an apparent Thirst after Other Mens Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</p>
                  <p>But that we may return to the Pretensions of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia,</hi> we must assert, That they are grounded upon the same Titles that acquir'd him the Possession of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> that is to say, upon the Marriage of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> with <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and more particularly upon. This, that <hi>Alsatia</hi> really depended upon <hi>Austria,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annex'd and united to it by the Emperor <hi>Sigismond,</hi> who gave it to the Dukes of <hi>Austria,</hi> who all along enjoy'd it without any Molestation, till such time as the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> wanting Money to carry on his War against the <hi>Turks,</hi> mortgag'd it to <hi>Charles</hi> the last Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> But he being slain before <hi>Nanci,</hi> and leaving no other Heirs but <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter, 'tis Evident that that same Province was to be return'd to <hi>Maximilian</hi> her Husband, to whom it belong'd by a double Right.</p>

And for the Preservation of his Right which he was not in a Condition to defend by the Sword, he took the Golden Fleece for his Order, and charg'd his Escotcheon with St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Cross, as his Successors doe also at this Day, who take upon 'em likewise the Title of <hi>Dukes of Burgundy.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>'TIs sufficiently known, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> was Lawful Heir to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> excepting the Dutchy which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in dispute. The sole Question then is, Whether it were really a Masculine Fief or no? This is that which was very much disputed at the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and which it will be a difficult Thing to decide. Not but that we know very well, that from <hi>Meroveus</hi> till <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Masculine Title was not admitted in Apanages, as is to be seen in the Houses of <hi>Dreux, Vermandois</hi> and <hi>Courtenay,</hi> which extinguish'd in the Females, and were translated into Strange Families; and to which, had there been any Occasion for it, there would have been as little regard had in the Royal Succession: but because this last House of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was set up since <hi>Philip</hi> who Establish'd that Custom, they will have it therefore to be subjected to it. Nevertheless, if we may be permitted to speak our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, we believe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is a Masculine Fief for two Reasons. First, because that in the Deed of Gift which King <hi>John</hi> made of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to his Fourth Son, <hi>Philip the Bold,</hi> there is no mention at all made of its reverting to the Crown, for want of Males, nor of any Exclusion of the Females, which however had been an Essential thing, had there been a Design to have settl'd it in that manner. The Second Reason is, because it may be said that King <hi>John</hi> himself held it in Right of his Mother <hi>Joan,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Robert</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> To which we may add the Resignation of <hi>Francis</hi> I. to <hi>Charles</hi> V. by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein he promises to restore it within Six Weeks after his Releasement, <hi>with all that</hi> Charles the Bold <hi>held at the time of his Death, and this in absolute Sovereignty, and without any Reserve; and if the said Restitution were not made, the King of</hi> France <hi>obliges himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Prisoner again.</hi> These are Words extracted out of the Third Article of the Treaty, from which the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have never derogated since, but on the Contrary, have since that, asserted their Rights afresh in the Treaties of <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Crepy.</hi>

                  <p>THey are so just and so clear, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> never rais'd any Dispute against 'em. This was the First who ever lay'd any Claim to it, or ever pretended that this Province belong'd to him by Right of Devolution, of which we have already spoken in the Chapter concerning the Queen's Titles; wherein because we have set forth the Reasons that destroy the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Pretensions, we referr the Reader to the same Chapter, rather then put our selves to the Trouble of repeating the same Thing over again. 'Tis sufficient to say that if the Devolution be quire out of doors, and the Queen's Renunciation of any Validity, the King of <hi>France</hi> had no Right to seize upon <hi>Franche Conté;</hi> and therefore the Title of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> remains in full Force and Vigour.</p>

                  <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. King of <hi>France,</hi> there were two very Great and Wealthy Heiresses to be marry'd; <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the other <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign.</hi> The Marriage of <hi>Charles</hi> with <hi>Margaret</hi> was concluded, tho' not Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated: but finding that <hi>Maximilian</hi> was about to Marry <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> by whom he should have in Dowry that Spacious Province, he broke off his First Match with the Heiress of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to marry <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign.</hi> Now because the Territories of that Princess held of <hi>Burgundy</hi> by Fealty and Homage, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> pretended that the King of <hi>France</hi> was become his Feudatary for that Province. But in regard that besides the Sovereignty, other Great Interests in the Property it self fell to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> the Reader is to understand, that after the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign</hi> was marry'd to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. by whom he had two Daughters, <hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Renee. Claudia</hi> was marry'd to <hi>Francis</hi> I. and from that Marriage descended <hi>Henry</hi> II. who was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Five Children, <hi>Elizabeth, Francis</hi> II. <hi>Charles</hi> IX. <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Alanson.</hi> These four Princes dy'd without Children. So that after the Death of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. in the Year 1589. the Male Race of the <hi>Valois</hi> extinguishing, the Crown fell to the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> On the other side, <hi>Philip</hi> the II. who had marry'd <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with great Importunity sollicited the General Estates in behalf of his Daughter <hi>Isabel,</hi> who as he pretended was Heir to the Crown, or at least to all the Female Fiefs, and particularly to the Dutchy of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> which was the Patrimony of her Grandmother <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and was not to be disputed against him, without Extream Injustice. But notwithstanding all that he could say or doe, that Province was not to be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Crown. Nevertheless the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Interest still holds good; and so far have the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> been from acknowledging any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46341:48"/> thing to the Contrary, that they have always renew'd their Claims by Treaties, and other Publick Acts; of which the most Signal was that of <hi>Blois,</hi> in the Year 1584. by which <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. promis'd, That in case he dy'd without Male Issue, the Dutchies of <hi>Milan, Burgundy, Bretaign,</hi> together with the Signiories of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> should descend to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> the Son of Arch-Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> in consideration of his Marriage with <hi>Claudia</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Daughter; which however was not perform'd: but by the breaking off that Marriage, a New Right fell to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> because that by the Contract it was covenanted, That if the Rupture happen'd to be on the King of <hi>France</hi>'s part, all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Territories should fall to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> as also, that if there were a failure on the Emperor's, or the Arch-Dukes side, they should Renounce all their Titles and Pretensions to the said Dominions. Now this Marriage fail'd on the King of <hi>France</hi>'s part, seeing that he caus'd a Petition to be presented to him in the Name of the General Estates in 1506. by which he was requested not to accomplish that Match, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give his Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Valois,</hi> as he had resolv'd to do before.</p>

                  <p>'TIs beyond all Controversie, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was Presumptive Heir to her Grandmother <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and to have been preferr'd before <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who came to the Crown by a Collateral Title only. But because the <hi>Salick</hi> Law is a Barrier which the French always set up in Opposition to those that lay claim to any of their Provinces, 'tis good to examine whether that Reason be of any Force, and sufficient to Exclude a Foreign Prince, to the depriving him of his Lawful Rights.</p>
                  <p>We have already declar'd, and we assert it once more, since our Subject leads us to it, That there is nothing more uncertain then the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Law, nothing more Scarce to be found then the Original Draught, or any ancient Copies of it, nor any thing so little known as what it contain'd. And it is most certain, that till the Time of <hi>Philip Valois,</hi> it was never so much as talk'd of; Nor do's it signifie any thing to alledge, that it was never known in <hi>France</hi> that the Daughters succeeded to the Crown; for indeed an Opportunity never presented it self: and if we may judge of that Article by the Author, 'tis most certain that it would be judg'd to be Apocryphal, for that nothing is so common in the History of <hi>France,</hi> as the Examples of Kings who have alienated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd their Dominions: witness <hi>Clovis</hi> the First, <hi>Lewis the Debonair,</hi> and almost all the rest that succeeded. Nevertheless, supposing that these two Articles were not invented and foisted in above Four Ages since, as many People believe, but that they were really a Part of the <hi>Salick</hi> Law, it must be always agreed, that they can be no Laws but within the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46341:49"/> of the Territories that Compos'd the Ancient Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and not in so many other Lovely Dominions as are fallen to it since, with their Privileges and Immunities. We must then take notice before all things, that this Vast Dominion of <hi>France</hi> is distinguish'd into Four Sorts of Countries; Countries of Favour, Countries of Estates, Countries of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and Countries of Pretension. Countries of Favour are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patrimony of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and which may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the Terms of the <hi>Salick Lands,</hi> containing <hi>Anjou, Maine,</hi> the Island of <hi>France, Tourain, Picardy, Beausse,</hi> and <hi>Champaign.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Estates, are they which have been annex'd to the Crown by Marriages, Wills, and Voluntary Donations, as <hi>Bretaign, Burgundy,</hi> the <hi>Dauphinate, Provence,</hi> &amp;c. Countries of Conquest, are <hi>Normandy, Guien,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> and by the Name of Countries of Pretensions, before the Reign of this present King, were meant <hi>Metz, Toul, Verdun,</hi> and <hi>Alsatia</hi> only: but at present we may comprehend under that Epithete, all the rest of his Conquests, whether in <hi>Germany, Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> But not to insist upon his Countries of Conquest or Pretension, which are nothing to our purpose, we shall only say, that in respect to those Provinces which are call'd Countries of Estates, that as they enjoy not their Liberties by vertue of any Privileges granted by the Kings out of Benevolence, or by way of Free Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>munities with which they came to the Crown, and were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to it upon Reciprocal Conditions on both sides, by which the Kings were bound to preserve and maintain 'em in their Usages, Customs and Franchises, without which they had never consented to their Union, 'tis clear as Day, that the Custom of Succession, which in all Countries is one of the Principal Articles of the Law of Usage, cannot be chang'd or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in any manner; this is Matter of Fact, which being once decided by the Rules of the Civil Law and Natural Right, the Dutchies of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Bretaign</hi> will belong to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as Successor to the Lawful Heirs. Which being a Truth so certain as it is, yet is it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the French, whose Fundamental Maxim it is <hi>Quod not possunt Regna inter se dividi, &amp; quod Regnum divisun in se desolabitur.</hi> But tho' we cannot blame a Prince that endeavours, as much as in him lies, to avoid the Alienation of his Dominions, yet on the other side, the Laws of Equity will not permit us to approve the Proceedings of a Prince, who building upon this Foundation, shall unjustly detain a Dominion that no way belongs to him. And indeed, were it needful to produce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples here, that under the two First Races, Alienations of the same Nature were made in the behalf of Females, and that afterwards the Masculine Claim was not admitted in Apanages, it would be easie for us to cite twenty against one; and therefore if we do it not, 'tis only to avoid Prolixity. In short, 'tis sufficient to read the History of <hi>France,</hi> for any Man to be Convinc'd; and thither it is that we therefore refer all those that are as yet unsatisfy'd. There they will see how many times the Sons of the Houses of <hi>France</hi> have ended in the Daughters, who have translated their Signiories into other Families, as appears by the Houses of <hi>Dreux, Vermandois, Courtenay,</hi> and others, and that the Dutchy of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46341:49"/>
                     <hi>Burgundy,</hi> though the First Fief, and of the greatest Importance, return'd not to King <hi>John,</hi> but in Right of his Mother <hi>Joan,</hi> who was Daughter and Heir of <hi>Robert</hi> II. And seeing that the same King <hi>John</hi> gave it to his Son <hi>Philip the Bold,</hi> by virtue of the same Title that he acquir d it, 'tis evident, that 'twas without any Reservation, and not in Male Apanage, as the French pretend; though this severe Law was constituted in his Father's time, as we have already observ'd.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, upon this it is, that they ground their most plausible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For say they, Though it be known that King <hi>John</hi> was Grand-child to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> by his Mother's side, however since the Law of Apanages was then establish'd, we ought to suppose that that Territory tell to him rather by Right of Reversion then otherwise. Which being so, it may be then asserted, That when King <hi>John</hi> gave it to his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> upon the same Title and Conditions that he receiv'd it himself, it was as a Male Apanage, because it did not return to him but by the Extinction of the Males. To dissolve this slight Objection, there needs no more but to come to the Fundamental Point of the Question, Whether King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> and his Successors, had a Power to Change the Municipal Laws of the States which had been United to their Crown by Marriages, Wills, Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Deeds of Gift, or other such like Contracts, without a General, Positive, and Authentick Consent of the States of the Country, resolv'd on in a Full and Free Assembly, set down in Writing, and sign'd by all the Principal Members of the Three<note n="*" place="margin">We find in the Regulations of <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> a Constitution very express upon this Subject. 'Twas the Will of that Emperor, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that the People who were present at the States, should be demanded what they thought of the New Laws which they were about to add to the Old ones; and not only that they should Consent thereto, but set their Hands at the bottom, in Testimony, that without their Authentick Consent the Law was invalid.</note> Orders? Now, far was that from being done in respect of any one of the Provinces in particular; nor do we find that since either <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> or any one of their Predecessors or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, have settl'd any thing in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Ancient Crown, either by the Consent of the States of the Kingdom, or of their own single Authority; all their Pretensions have no other Ground then a Supposition which they would deduce from an unknown Law, that they have taken no body knows from whence, and which, though it were as real and certain as it uncertain, could be of no Force, but only in the Extent of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> But 'tis not of late Days that this Question has been debated. In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> there were whole Volumes written upon this Subject; and since that time, the Successions of <hi>Burgundy, Bretaign,</hi> and the Affair of the <hi>Regale,</hi> found the Historians a large Field wherein to exercise their Pens: and though the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have not wanted store of wretched Flatterers, who have done their utmost to ascribe to 'em an Unjust and Tyrannick Power, never any one of 'em as yet could solidly make good his Opinion, nor answer effectually what has been written. The greatest part of the most Equal and Impartial Doctors have likewise always upheld, That it is not in the Power of Kings
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46341:50"/> to Declare War, and Levy Taxes, without the Consent of the States of the Kingdom, much less to abrogate their Municipal Laws, on purpose to subject 'em to their Will. You shall hear what the Chancellor <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> says, in his <hi>Speech</hi> concerning the Benefit of Assemblies of Estates. 'Tis the same that he pronounc'd in the Assembly of Estates at <hi>Orleans,</hi> in the Year 1561. <q>Estates (says he) are assembl'd for divers Causes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the present Occurrences and Occasions, or else for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Assistance of Men and Money, or to Regulate Justice, or to Declare War, or to Provide for the Means to Support it, or to Regulate the Order of Successions in the Apanages of the Sons of <hi>France,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws and Customs of the Places, and sometimes to know to whom the Crown of <hi>France</hi> belongs, as was to be seen after the Death of <hi>Charles the Fair,</hi> upon the Difference between <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> in which Estates <hi>Philip</hi> did not preside, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Party.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a little higher, he says, <q>To hold an Assembly of Estates, is for the King to Conferr with his Subjects, to take their Advice and Counsel upon Affairs of Importance, and Resolve with their Concurrence upon what is most expedient to be done. This was anciently call'd <hi>Holding a Parlament;</hi> which Name is still retain'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where Affairs are handl'd after the same manner as they were wont to be in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another part, he thus goes on, <q>The last Estates were held at the Beginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. his Successor, gave over holding Estates; nor did he ever assemble any, either General or Provincial; not by that means to enlarge his own Power, or for fear of giving too much Authority to his People, or out of any desire to Oppress 'em; for never was a more Popular King in the World, nor one that lov'd his Subjects better. For which Reason, after his Death, he was call'd the <hi>Father of his People.</hi> But because he was unwilling to put his People to Charges, and for that when he had Occasion, they were so Obedient, that he found there was no Occasion for Calling an Assembly. On the other side, he was careful to Protect and Preserve their Laws Privileges, and to Provide for their Necessities, without expecting their Addresses.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, we leave it to Judgment, whether the last Kings of <hi>France</hi> have pursu'd these Maxims; they who at this present talk no other Language, but, <hi>We Will, and it is Our Pleasure;</hi> and, <hi>For such is Our Pleasure;</hi> and who glory in abridging and abrogating the Franchises of the Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjection; witness that of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> that of <hi>Provence,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the City of <hi>Marseilles.</hi> But we need not a more remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample then that which is reported by a certain Author of a New Voyage into the <hi>Levant.</hi> He says, That the King of <hi>France</hi> passing thorough the City of <hi>Dijon,</hi> the Mayor and Sheriffs brought him their Charters, and the Franchises of their Provinces, and of their City, beseeching him that he would vouchsafe to swear to observe 'em, as the Kings his Predecessors had oblig'd themselves to do, not only at their coming to the Crown, but also upon their first entrance into the City of <hi>Dijon.</hi> To whom Cardinal
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46341:50"/>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> made Answer with a menacing Look, <hi>Have you the Insolence to require your King to Swear?</hi> Upon which they replying, That they requir'd nothing, only they besought and were in hopes of that Favour and Justice from the King's Goodness: the Cardinal retorted, <hi>I see what you would be at; you would be a Free City, and a Republick: very good; I declare to yee, in the King's Name, That without swearing, he looks upon yee as such; but prepare your selves to be his Conquest within Four and twenty Hours.</hi> This is call d <hi>Pulling off the Mask:</hi> and after a Declaration so plain, it would be to no purpose to add any thing more.</p>

The Question was a long time toss'd to and fro, and hotly debated; till at length the French, who were willing to have a King of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, suffer'd themselves to be over-rul'd by the Bishop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> who cry'd out as if he had been inspir'd, <hi>Behold the Lillies of the Field, that neither work nor spin,</hi> (as we have already observ'd in another Place.)

                     </gap>ngly insisted, and quoted, the first time that ever it was cited, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle that excludes the Female Sex. That Law, of which they never had any Knowledge till then, so highly pleas'd the French, that it was receiv'd with Applause by all the Nation, not only because they found it confirm'd by the Verse of the Gospel, but chiefly, for that the greatest part sought only a plausible Pretence to exclude <hi>Edward,</hi> and follow their Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. <hi>Philip</hi> then was unanimously Proclaim'd in the said Assembly; and the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was come thither to make good his Claim, was forc'd to brook the Disgrace of seeing himself rejected, without daring to complain, as being in the Hands of his Competitor, who would have been glad of a Pretence to have secur'd him, for the preventing a War which he foresaw inevitable. But not daring to do it without some apparent Reason, he oblig'd him, however, to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and do him Homage in Person, for the Provinces of <hi>Guienne, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Poitou;</hi> which was done with the greatest Magnificence that could be, to extenuate, in some measure, the Vassalage of the Action. Nevertheless, the Vexation for having
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46341:51"/> appear'd in sight of the whole Court of <hi>France,</hi> upon his Knees, and Bare-headed, before a Chancellor, and promis'd Fealty to a Prince that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected should have been his Subject, rais'd his Fury to that heighth, that from that day forward he vow'd to his own People, That so soon as he got home, he would take Arms, and never lay 'em down, till he had made himself Master of <hi>France.</hi> In a word, he was no sooner return'd to <hi>London,</hi> but he quarter'd the Arms of <hi>France</hi> with those of <hi>England,</hi> levy'd a Powerful Army, and march'd against <hi>Philip,</hi> assisted by the Flemings who took his Part. And this War prov'd successful to him; for he vanquish'd <hi>Philip</hi> in several Encounters, more-especially at the Battle of <hi>Crecy,</hi> and at several times kill'd him above a Hunder'd and fifty thousand Men, among which were a great number of the Nobility of the Kingdom; after which, he took <hi>Calais,</hi> which the English held from that time till the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Nor was this all; for King <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his Father, and marching against <hi>Edward,</hi> sirnam'd the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to revenge his Father's Losses, was himself overthrown with a great slaughter of the French Nobility, and the loss of his own Liberty, being carry'd first to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> then belonging to the English; and from thence into <hi>England:</hi> from whence he was releas'd, after six Years being detain'd, upon delivery of Hostages; for the discharge of which, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THey are grounded (as we have made it appear) upon Two Rights. The First is, The Marriage of the King of <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip the Fair.</hi> The Second is, Another Marriage with <hi>Catherine</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. King of <hi>France,</hi> As to the Second, we do not believe that of it self it is of any Force, were it not made Authentick by the First. For in short, it is beyond all Controversie, that <hi>Charles</hi> VI. who by some is call'd <hi>The Ideot,</hi> by others, <hi>The Mad-man,</hi> had not the Power, nor any Right to deprive his Son of the Lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession which by Nature and Blood were due to him, to make way for a Foreigner: and if the Parlament, and Grandees of the Kingdom approv'd the Disinheriting of the Prince, the Dauphin, who never gave his Consent, might justly tax 'em of Rebellion and Infidelity to their Lawful Sovereign. Which being taken for granted, it would be in vain for the King of <hi>England</hi> afterwards to alledge Possession, and the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Son at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in regard that Marriage may be look'd upon as a Consequence of the former, and for that the Covenants agreed to between <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Isabel</hi> his Wife, with <hi>Henry</hi> V. as also the Approbations and Verifications of the Parlament, may be taken for Acts of that Restitution which Justice abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely demanded from 'em, to the Exclusion of their own Sons, and may be said to proceed from their certain knowledge, and there being convinc'd that the Crown belong'd to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in Right of <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> it only remains to examin whether that Princess could legally pretend to succeed her Father in the Sovereignty. If you will believe the Bishop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> with his <hi>Lilia neque laborant neque nent,</hi> 'tis certainly not to be permitted. But in regard that Sentence is of too fresh a date, in reference to the Point in dispute, though the Kings of <hi>France</hi> found it convenient for their Turn, yet we think it much the safer course to stick close to the Ancient and Fundamental Laws. I know the French will presently fly for Succour to the Salique Law: but we have said so much already concerning the Uncertainty, and consequently the Insufficiency of that Law, and how much the Learned are divided in their Opinions about it; the greatest part agreeing, That neither Inalienation, nor the Exclusion of Females were heard of, or ever mention'd before the Contest between <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> may be very well allow'd to justifie and prosecute his Claim; which is so much the more Authentick at this day, because there has never been any Prescription against it: so far from any such thing, that their Claims have been renew'd by frequent Instances and Protestations, confirm'd by Acts of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. and his Parlament, and a Coronation of the King of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <p>THESE Provinces fell to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Lewis</hi> VI. with <hi>Eleanor,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Raymund</hi> Count of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,</hi> who was the Lord of 'em: and because that in his Expedition to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> (for he took her along with him,) he had some Reasons to be ill satisfy'd with her Behaviour, more-especially upon a Suspicion that she had been free of her last Favours to <hi>Saladin</hi> Prince of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was his Prisoner, he Divorc'd her upon his Return to <hi>France,</hi> upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being too nearly related in the Degrees of Spiritual Consanguinity, as having been God-father and God-mother at the same time to one and the same Child. This trivial Cause being judg'd sufficient by the Council of <hi>Boisgenci,</hi> their Marriage was Dissolv'd; and Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> taking her

                  <head>Enquiries into the Pretensions of the King of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Guienne, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Poitou.</hi>

                  <p>WE have no other Reflexions to make upon these Pretensions, then what we have already observ'd in the preceding Chapter. All these Titles are very good; only they are a little too far superannuated to be the lawful Occasion of a War. But if in the Revolution that is already begun, the King of <hi>England</hi> should find an Opportunity once more to seize upon his Own, there is no legal Obstacle that can hinder him.</p>
